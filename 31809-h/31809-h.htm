OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</h2>

<h3>VII</h3>

<h3>THE RIVIERA AGAIN&mdash;MARSEILLES
AND HYÃˆRES</h3>

<h5><span class="sc">October</span> 1882&mdash;<span class="sc">August</span> 1884</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> the two years and odd months since his return from
California, Stevenson had made no solid gain of health.
His winters, and especially his second winter, at Davos
had seemed to do him much temporary good; but during
the summers in Scotland he had lost as much as he had
gained, or more. Loving the Mediterranean shores of
France from of old, he now made up his mind to try them
once again.</p>

<p>As the ways and restrictions of a settled invalid were
repugnant to Stevenson&rsquo;s character and instincts, so were
the life and society of a regular invalid station depressing
and uncongenial to him. He determined, accordingly,
to avoid settling in one of these, and hoped to find
a suitable climate and habitation that should be near,
though not in, some centre of the active and ordinary life
of man, with accessible markets, libraries, and other
resources. In September 1882 he started with his cousin
Mr. R. A. M. Stevenson in search of a new home, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
thought first of trying the Languedoc coast, a region new
to him. At Montpellier, he was laid up again with a bad
bout of his lung troubles; and, the doctor not recommending
him to stay, returned to Marseilles. Here he was
rejoined by his wife, and after a few days&rsquo; exploration in
the neighbourhood they lighted on what seemed exactly
the domicile they wanted. This was a roomy and attractive
enough house and garden called the Campagne Defli,
near the manufacturing suburb of St. Marcel, in a sheltered
position in full view of the shapely coastward hills.
By the third week in October they were installed, and in
eager hopes of pleasant days to come and a return to
working health. These hopes were not realised. Week
after week went on, and the hemorrhages and fits of
fever and exhaustion did not diminish. Work, except
occasional verses, and a part of the story called <i>The
Treasure of Franchard</i>, would not flow, and the time had
to be whiled away with games of patience and other
resources of the sick man. Nearly two months were thus
passed; during the whole of one of them Stevenson had
not been able to go beyond the garden; and by Christmas
he had to face the fact that the air of the place was tainted.
An epidemic of fever, due to some defect of drainage,
broke out, and it became clear that this could be no home
for Stevenson. Accordingly, at his wife&rsquo;s instance, though
having scarce the strength to travel, he left suddenly for
Nice, she staying behind to pack their chattels and wind
up their affairs and responsibilities as well as might be.
Various misadventures, miscarriages of telegrams, journeys
taken at cross purposes and the like, making existence
uncomfortably dramatic at the moment, caused the couple
to believe for a while that they had fairly lost each other.
Mrs. Stevenson allows me to print a letter from herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
to Mr. J. A. Symonds vividly relating these predicaments
(see p. 11 foll.). At last, in the course of January,
they came safely together at Marseilles, and next made
a few weeks&rsquo; stay at Nice, where Stevenson&rsquo;s health quickly
mended. Thence they returned as far as HyÃ¨res. Staying
here through the greater part of February, at the HÃ´tel
des ÃŽles d&rsquo;Or, and finding the place to their liking, they
cast about once more for a resting-place, and were this
time successful.</p>

<p>The house chosen by the Stevensons at HyÃ¨res was
not near the sea, but inland, on the road above the old
town and beneath the ruins of the castle. The Chalet La
Solitude it was called; a cramped but habitable cottage
built in the Swiss manner, with a pleasant strip of garden,
and a view and situation hardly to be bettered. Here he
and his family lived for the next sixteen months (March
1883 to July 1884). To the first part of this period he
often afterwards referred as the happiest time of his life.
His malady remained quiescent enough to afford, at least
to his own buoyant spirit, a strong hope of ultimate
recovery. He delighted in his surroundings, and realised
for the first time the joys of a true home of his own. The
last shadow of a cloud between himself and his parents
had long passed away; and towards his father, now in
declining health, and often suffering from moods of
constitutional depression, the son begins on his part
to assume, how touchingly and tenderly will be seen
from the following letters, a quasi-paternal attitude
of encouragement and monition. At the same
time his work on the completion of the <i>Silverado Squatters</i>,
on <i>Prince Otto</i>, the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden of Verses</i> (for which
his own name was <i>Penny Whistles</i>), on the <i>Black Arrow</i>
(designated hereinafter, on account of its Old English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
dialect, as &ldquo;tushery&rdquo;), and other undertakings prospered
well. In the autumn the publication of <i>Treasure
Island</i> in book form brought with it the first breath of
popular applause. The reader will see how modest a price
Stevenson was content, nay, delighted, to receive for this
classic. It was two or three years yet before he could earn
enough to support himself and his family by literature:
a thing he had always been earnestly bent on doing, regarding
it as the only justification for his chosen way of life.
In the meantime, it must be understood, whatever help
he needed from his father was from the hour of his marriage
always amply and ungrudgingly given.</p>

<p>In September of the same year, 1883, Stevenson had
felt deeply the death of his old friend James Walter
Ferrier (see the essay <i>Old Mortality</i> and the references in
the following letters). But still his health held out fairly,
until, in January 1884, on a visit to Nice, he was unexpectedly
prostrated anew by an acute congestion of the
internal organs, which for the time being brought him to
death&rsquo;s door. Returning to his home, his recovery had
been only partial when, after four months (May 1884), a
recurrence of violent hemorrhages from the lung once
more prostrated him completely; soon after which he
quitted HyÃ¨res, and the epidemic of cholera which broke
out there the same summer prevented all thoughts of
his return.</p>

<p>The HyÃ¨res time, both during the happy and hard-working
months of March-December 1883, and the semi-convalescence
of February-May 1884, was a prolific one
in the way of correspondence; and there is perhaps no
period of his life when his letters reflect so fully the variety
of his moods and the eagerness of his occupations.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span></p>

<p class="to">To the Editor of the New York Tribune</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>At Marseilles, while waiting to occupy the house which he had
leased in the suburbs of that city, Stevenson learned that his old
friend and kind adviser, Mr. James Payn, with whom he had been
intimate as sub-editor of the Cornhill Magazine under Mr. Leslie
Stephen in the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s, had been inadvertently represented in the
columns of the New York Tribune as a plagiarist of R. L. S. In
order to put matters right, he at once sent the following letter both
to the Tribune and to the London AthenÃ¦um:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Terminus Hotel, Marseilles, October</i> 16, 1882.</p>

<p><span class="scs">SIR</span>,&mdash;It has come to my ears that you have lent the
authority of your columns to an error.</p>

<p>More than half in pleasantry&mdash;and I now think the
pleasantry ill-judged&mdash;I complained in a note to my <i>New
Arabian Nights</i> that some one, who shall remain nameless
for me, had borrowed the idea of a story from one of
mine. As if I had not borrowed the ideas of the half of
my own! As if any one who had written a story ill had
a right to complain of any other who should have written
it better! I am indeed thoroughly ashamed of the note,
and of the principle which it implies.</p>

<p>But it is no mere abstract penitence which leads me to
beg a corner of your paper&mdash;it is the desire to defend the
honour of a man of letters equally known in America and
England, of a man who could afford to lend to me and
yet be none the poorer; and who, if he would so far condescend,
has my free permission to borrow from me all
that he can find worth borrowing.</p>

<p>Indeed, sir, I am doubly surprised at your correspondent&rsquo;s
error. That James Payn should have borrowed
from me is already a strange conception. The author of
<i>Lost Sir Massingberd</i> and <i>By Proxy</i> may be trusted to
invent his own stories. The author of <i>A Grape from a
Thorn</i> knows enough, in his own right, of the humorous
and pathetic sides of human nature.</p>

<p>But what is far more monstrous&mdash;what argues total
ignorance of the man in question&mdash;is the idea that James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
Payn could ever have transgressed the limits of professional
propriety. I may tell his thousands of readers on
your side of the Atlantic that there breathes no man of
letters more inspired by kindness and generosity to his
brethren of the profession, and, to put an end to any
possibility of error, I may be allowed to add that I often
have recourse, and that I had recourse once more but a
few weeks ago, to the valuable practical help which he
makes it his pleasure to extend to younger men.</p>

<p>I send a duplicate of this letter to a London weekly;
for the mistake, first set forth in your columns, has already
reached England, and my wanderings have made me
perhaps last of the persons interested to hear a word
of it.&mdash;I am, etc.,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BOB</span>,&mdash;We have found a house!&mdash;at Saint
Marcel, Banlieue de Marseille. In a lovely valley between
hills part wooded, part white cliffs; a house of a dining-room,
of a fine salon&mdash;one side lined with a long divan&mdash;three
good bedrooms (two of them with dressing-rooms),
three small rooms (chambers of <i>bonne</i> and sich), a large
kitchen, a lumber room, many cupboards, a back court,
a large olive yard, cultivated by a resident <i>paysan</i>, a
well, a berceau, a good deal of rockery, a little pine
shrubbery, a railway station in front, two lines of omnibus
to Marseille.</p>

<p class="center">Â£48 per annum.</p>

<p>It is called Campagne Defli! query Campagne Debug?
The Campagne Demosquito goes on here nightly, and
is very deadly. Ere we can get installed, we shall be
beggared to the door, I see.</p>

<p>I vote for separations; F.&rsquo;s arrival here, after our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
separation, was better fun to me than being married was
by far. A separation completed is a most valuable property;
worth piles.&mdash;Ever your affectionate cousin,</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Terminus Hotel, Marseille, le 17th October</i> 1882.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;We grow, every time we see it,
more delighted with our house. It is five miles out of
Marseilles, in a lovely spot, among lovely wooded and
cliffy hills&mdash;most mountainous in line&mdash;far lovelier, to my
eyes, than any Alps. To-day we have been out inventorying;
and though a mistral blew, it was delightful in an
open cab, and our house with the windows open was
heavenly, soft, dry, sunny, southern. I fear there are
fleas&mdash;it is called Campagne Defli&mdash;and I look forward
to tons of insecticide being employed.</p>

<p>I have had to write a letter to the New York Tribune

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;Your delightful letters duly arrived
this morning. They were the only good feature of the
day, which was not a success. Fanny was in bed&mdash;she
begged I would not split upon her, she felt so guilty;
but as I believe she is better this evening, and has a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
chance to be right again in a day or two, I will disregard
her orders. I do not go back, but do not go forward&mdash;or
not much. It is, in one way, miserable&mdash;for I can do
no work; a very little wood-cutting, the newspapers,
and a note about every two days to write, completely
exhausts my surplus energy; even Patience I have to
cultivate with parsimony. I see, if I could only get to
work, that we could live here with comfort, almost with
luxury. Even as it is, we should be able to get through
a considerable time of idleness. I like the place immensely,
though I have seen so little of it&mdash;I have only
been once outside the gate since I was here! It puts me
in mind of a summer at Prestonpans and a sickly child
you once told me of.</p>

<p>Thirty-two years now finished! My twenty-ninth was
in San Francisco, I remember&mdash;rather a bleak birthday.
The twenty-eighth was not much better; but the rest

<p class="to">To Trevor Haddon</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Campagne Defli, St. Marcel, Dec</i>. 29<i>th,</i> 1882.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;I am glad you sent me your note, I had
indeed lost your address, and was half thinking to try
the Ringstown one; but far from being busy, I have
been steadily ill. I was but three or four days in London,
waiting till one of my friends was able to accompany me,
and had neither time nor health to see anybody but some
publisher people. Since then I have been worse and
better, better and worse, but never able to do any work
and for a large part of the time forbidden to write and
even to play Patience, that last of civilised amusements.
In brief, I have been &ldquo;the sheer hulk&rdquo; to a degree almost
outside of my experience, and I desire all my friends to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
forgive me my sins of omission this while back. I only
wish you were the only one to whom I owe a letter, or
many letters.</p>

<p>But you see, at least, you had done nothing to offend
me; and I dare say you will let me have a note from time
to time, until we shall have another chance to meet.&mdash;Yours
sincerely,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1">An excellent new year to you, and many of them.</p>

<p>If you chance to see a paragraph in the papers describing
my illness, and the &ldquo;delicacies suitable to my invalid
condition&rdquo; cooked in copper, and the other ridiculous and
revolting yarns, pray regard it as a spectral illusion, and
pass by.</p>


<p class="to">[<span class="sc">Mrs. R. L. Stevenson<br />

<div class="quote">
<p>I intercalate here Mrs. Stevenson&rsquo;s extremely vivid and characteristic
account of the weird misadventures that befell the pair during
their retreat from St. Marcel in search of a healthier home.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Campagne Defli, St. Marcel, January</i> 1883.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MR. SYMONDS</span>,&mdash;What must you think of
us? I hardly dare write to you. What do you do when
people to whom you have been the dearest of friends
requite you by acting like fiends? I do hope you heap
coals of fire on their heads in the good old Christian sense.</p>

<p>Louis has been very ill again. I hasten to say that he
is now better. But I thought at one time he would never
be better again. He had continual hemorrhages and
became so weak that he was twice insensible in one day,
and was for a long time like one dead. At the worst fever
broke out in this village, typhus, I think, and all day the
death-bells rang, and we could hear the chanting whilst
the wretched villagers carried about their dead lying bare
to the sun on their coffin-lids, so spreading the contagion
through the streets. The evening of the day when Louis
was so long insensible the weather changed, becoming very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
clear and fine and greatly refreshing and reviving him.
Then I said if it held good he should start in the morning
for Nice and try what a change might do. Just at that time
there was not money enough for the two of us, so he had
to start alone, though I expected soon to be able to follow
him. During the night a peasant-man died in a house in
our garden, and in the morning the corpse, hideously swollen
in the stomach, was lying on its coffin-lid at our gates.
Fortunately it was taken away just before Louis went,
and he didn&rsquo;t see it nor hear anything about it until afterwards.
I had been back and forth all the morning from
the door to the gates, and from the gates to the door,
in an agony lest Louis should have to pass it on his way
out.</p>

<p>I was to have a despatch from Toulon where Louis
was to pass the night, two hours from St. Marcel, and
another from Nice, some few hours further, the next day.
I waited one, two, three, four days, and no word came.
Neither telegram nor letter. The evening of the fourth
day I went to Marseilles and telegraphed to the Toulon
and Nice stations and to the bureau of police. I had been
pouring out letters to every place I could think of. The
people at Marseilles were very kind and advised me to
take no further steps to find my husband. He was certainly
dead, they said. It was plain that he stopped at
some little station on the road, speechless and dying,
and it was now too late to do anything; I had much
better return at once to my friends. &ldquo;Eet ofen &rsquo;appens
so,&rdquo; said the Secretary, and &ldquo;Oh yes, all right, very
well,&rdquo; added a Swiss in a sympathetic voice. I waited
all night at Marseilles and got no answer, all the next day
and got no answer; then I went back to St. Marcel and
there was nothing there. At eight I started on the train
with Lloyd who had come for his holidays, but it only
took us to Toulon where again I telegraphed. At last I
got an answer the next day at noon. I waited at Toulon
for the train I had reason to believe Louis travelled by,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
intending to stop at every station and inquire for him
until I got to Nice. Imagine what those days were to me.
I never received any of the letters Louis had written to
me, and he was reading the first he had received from me
when I knocked at his door. A week afterwards I had
an answer from the police. Louis was much better: the
change and the doctor, who seems very clever, have done
wonderful things for him. It was during this first day of
waiting that I received your letter. There was a vague
comfort in it like a hand offered in the darkness, but I
did not read it until long after.</p>

<p>We have had many other wild misadventures, Louis
has twice (started) actually from Nice under a misapprehension.
At this moment I believe him to be at Marseilles,
stopping at the Hotel du Petit Louvre; I am supposed
to be packing here at St. Marcel, afterwards we are to go
somewhere, perhaps to the Lake of Geneva. My nerves
were so shattered by the terrible suspense I endured that
memorable week that I have not been fit to do much.
When I was returning from Nice a dreadful old man with
a fat wife and a weak granddaughter sat opposite me and
plied me with the most extraordinary questions. He
began by asking if Lloyd was any connection of mine, and
ended I believe by asking my mother&rsquo;s maiden name.
Another of the questions he put to me was where Louis
wished to be buried, and whether I could afford to have
him embalmed when he died. When the train stopped
the only other passenger, a quiet man in a corner who
looked several times as if he wished to interfere and stop
the old man but was too shy, came to me and said that
he knew Sidney Colvin and he knew you, and that you
were both friends of Louis; and that his name was Basil
Hammond,<a name="FnAnchor_1" id="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and he wished to stay on a day in Marseilles
and help me work off my affairs. I accepted his offer with
heartfelt thanks. I was extremely ill next day, but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
two went about and arranged about giving up this house
and what compensation, and did some things that I could
not have managed alone. My French is useful only in
domestic economy, and even that, I fear, is very curious
and much of it patois. Wasn&rsquo;t that a good fellow, and a
kind fellow?&mdash;I cannot tell you how grateful I am, words
are such feeble things&mdash;at least for that purpose. For
anger, justifiable wrath, they are all too forcible. It was
very bad of me not to write to you, we talked of you so
often and thought of you so much, and I always said&mdash;&ldquo;now
I will write&rdquo;&mdash;and then somehow I could not....</p>

<p class="to">To Charles Baxter</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>After his Christmas flight to Marseilles and thence to Nice,
Stevenson began to mend quickly. In this letter to Mr. Baxter
he acknowledges the receipt of a specimen proof, set up for their
private amusement, of <i>Brashiana</i>, the series of burlesque sonnets
he had written at Davos in memory of the Edinburgh publican
already mentioned. It should be explained that in their correspondence
Stevenson and Mr. Baxter were accustomed to keep up
an old play of their student days by merging their identities in those
of two fictitious personages, Thomson and Johnson, imaginary types
of Edinburgh character, and ex-elders of the Scottish Kirk.</p>

<p>Stevenson here narrates in his own fashion by what generalship
he at last got rid of the Campagne Defli without having to pay
compensation as his wife expected.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel du Petit Louvre, Marseille, 15 Feb.</i> 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;This is to intimate to you that Mr. and

<p>The parents are both doing much better than could
be expected; particularly the dear papa.</p>

<p>There, Colvin, I did it this time. Huge success. The
propriÃ©taires were scattered like chaff. If it had not been
the agent, may Israel now say, if it had not been the
agent who was on our side! But I made the agent
march! I threatened law; I was Immense&mdash;what do
I say?&mdash;Immeasurable. The agent, however, behaved
well and is a fairly honest little one-eared, white-eyed tom-cat
of an opera-going gold-hunter. The propriÃ©taire <i>non est
inventa</i>; we countermarched her, got in valuators; and in
place of a hundred francs in her pocket, she got nothing,
and I paid <i>one</i> silver biscuit! It <i>might</i> go further but I am
convinced will not, and anyway, I fear not the consequences.</p>

<p>The weather is incredible; my heart sings; my health
satisfies even my wife. I did jolly well right to come
after all and she now admits it. For she broke down as
I knew she would, and I from here, without passing a
night at the Defli, though with a cruel effusion of coach-hires,
took up the wondrous tale and steered the ship
through. I now sit crowned with laurel and literally
exulting in kudos. The affair has been better managed
than our two last winterings,&mdash;I am yours,</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Nice, February</i> 1883.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CUMMY</span>,&mdash;You must think, and quite justly,
that I am one of the meanest rogues in creation. But
though I do not write (which is a thing I hate), it by no
means follows that people are out of my mind. It is
natural that I should always think more or less about
you, and still more natural that I should think of you
when I went back to Nice. But the real reason why you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
have been more in my mind than usual is because of some
little verses that I have been writing, and that I mean
to make a book of; and the real reason of this letter
(although I ought to have written to you anyway) is that
I have just seen that the book in question must be dedicated
to</p>

<p class="sc center">Alison Cunningham,</p>

<p class="noind">the only person who will really understand it, I don&rsquo;t
know when it may be ready, for it has to be illustrated,
but I hope in the meantime you may like the idea of
what is to be; and when the time comes, I shall try to
make the dedication as pretty as I can make it. Of
course, this is only a flourish, like taking off one&rsquo;s hat;
but still, a person who has taken the trouble to write
things does not dedicate them to any one without meaning
it; and you must just try to take this dedication in
place of a great many things that I might have said, and
that I ought to have done, to prove that I am not altogether
unconscious of the great debt of gratitude I owe
you. This little book, which is all about my childhood,
should indeed go to no other person but you, who did so
much to make that childhood happy.</p>

<p>Do you know, we came very near sending for you this
winter. If we had not had news that you were ill too, I
almost believe we should have done so, we were so much
in trouble.</p>

<p>I am now very well; but my wife has had a very, very
bad spell, through overwork and anxiety, when I was
<i>lost</i>! I suppose you heard of that. She sends you her
love, and hopes you will write to her, though she no more
than I deserves it. She would add a word herself, but
she is too played out.&mdash;I am, ever your old boy,</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Stevenson was by this time beginning to send home some of the
MS. of the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>, the title of which had not yet been settled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
The pieces as first numbered are in a different order from that afterwards
adopted, but the reader will easily identify the references.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Nice, March</i> 1883.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;This is to announce to you the MS.
of Nursery Verses, now numbering <span class="sc">XLVIII</span>. pieces or 599
verses, which, of course, one might augment <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>But here is my notion to make all clear.</p>

<p>I do not want a big ugly quarto; my soul sickens at
the look of a quarto. I want a refined octavo, not large&mdash;not
<i>larger</i> than the Donkey book, at any price.</p>

<p>I think the full page might hold four verses of four
lines, that is to say, counting their blanks at two, of
twenty-two lines in height. The first page of each number
would only hold two verses or ten lines, the title being
low down. At this rate, we should have seventy-eight or
eighty pages of letterpress.</p>

<p>The designs should not be in the text, but facing the
poem; so that if the artist liked, he might give two pages
of design to every poem that turned the leaf, <i>i.e.</i> longer
than eight lines, <i>i.e.</i> to twenty-eight out of the forty-six.
I should say he would not use this privilege (?) above
five times, and some he might scorn to illustrate at all,
so we may say fifty drawings. I shall come to the drawings
next.</p>

<p>But now you see my book of the thickness, since the
drawings count two pages, of 180 pages; and since the
paper will perhaps be thicker, of near two hundred by
bulk. It is bound in a quiet green with the words in thin
gilt. Its shape is a slender, tall octavo. And it sells for
the publisher&rsquo;s fancy, and it will be a darling to look at;
in short, it would be like one of the original Heine books
in type and spacing.</p>

<p>Now for the pictures. I take another sheet and begin
to jot notes for them when my imagination serves: I will
run through the book, writing when I have an idea. There,
I have jotted enough to give the artist a notion. Of
course, I don&rsquo;t do more than contribute ideas, but I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
be happy to help in any and every way. I may as well
add another idea; when the artist finds nothing much
to illustrate, a good drawing of any <i>object</i> mentioned in
the text, were it only a loaf of bread or a candlestick,
is a most delightful thing to a young child. I remember
this keenly.</p>

<p>Of course, if the artist insists on a larger form, I must,
I suppose, bow my head. But my idea I am convinced is
the best, and would make the book truly, not fashionably
pretty.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that I shall have a dedication; I
am going to dedicate &rsquo;em to Cummy; it will please her,
and lighten a little my burthen of ingratitude. A low
affair is the Muse business.</p>

<p>I will add no more to this lest you should want to communicate
with the artist; try another sheet. I wonder
how many I&rsquo;ll keep wandering to.</p>

<p>O I forgot. As for the title, I think &ldquo;Nursery Verses&rdquo;
the best. Poetry is not the strong point of the text, and
I shrink from any title that might seem to claim that
quality; otherwise we might have &ldquo;Nursery Muses&rdquo; or
&ldquo;New Songs of Innocence&rdquo; (but that were a blasphemy),
or &ldquo;Rimes of Innocence&rdquo;: the last not bad, or&mdash;an idea&mdash;&ldquo;The
Jews&rsquo; Harp,&rdquo; or&mdash;now I have it&mdash;&ldquo;The Penny
Whistle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;It must be at least a fortnight
since we have had a scratch of a pen from you; and if
it had not been for Cummy&rsquo;s letter, I should have feared
you were worse again: as it is, I hope we shall hear from
you to-day or to-morrow at latest.</p>

<p><i>Health.</i>&mdash;Our news is good: Fanny never got so bad
as we feared, and we hope now that this attack may pass
off in threatenings. I am greatly better, have gained
flesh, strength, spirits; eat well, walk a good deal, and
do some work without fatigue. I am off the sick list.</p>

<p><i>Lodging.</i>&mdash;We have found a house up the hill, close
to the town, an excellent place though very, very little.
If I can get the landlord to agree to let us take it by the

are again installed, and to receive a letter dated thus:&mdash;</p>

2000 f. However, I hope we may get it, as it is healthy,
cheerful, and close to shops, and society, and civilisation.

<p>&ldquo;Cassandra&rdquo; was a nickname of the elder Mr. Stevenson for
his daughter-in-law. The scheme of a play to be founded on <i>Great
Expectations</i> was one of a hundred formed in these days and afterwards
given up.</p>

la Solitude, HyÃ¨res-les-Palmiers, Var, France,
March</i> 17, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;Your undated favour from Eastbourne
came to hand in course of post, and I now hasten to
acknowledge its receipt. We must ask you in future, for
the convenience of our business arrangements, to struggle
with and tread below your feet this most unsatisfactory
and uncommercial habit. Our Mr. Cassandra is better;
our Mr. Wogg expresses himself dissatisfied with our new
place of business; when left alone in the front shop, he
bawled like a parrot; it is supposed the offices are haunted.</p>

<p>To turn to the matter of your letter, your remarks on
<i>Great Expectations</i> are very good. We have both re-read
it this winter, and I, in a manner, twice. The object
being a play; the play, in its rough outline, I now see:
and it is extraordinary how much of Dickens had to be
discarded as unhuman, impossible, and ineffective: all
that really remains is the loan of a file (but from a grown-up
young man who knows what he was doing, and to a
convict who, although he does not know it is his father&mdash;the
father knows it is his son), and the fact of the convict-father&rsquo;s
return and disclosure of himself to the son
whom he has made rich. Everything else has been thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
aside; and the position has had to be explained by a
prologue which is pretty strong. I have great hopes of
this piece, which is very amiable and, in places, very
strong indeed: but it was curious how Dickens had to be
rolled away; he had made his story turn on such improbabilities,
such fantastic trifles, not on a good human basis,
such as I recognised. You are right about the casts, they
were a capital idea; a good description of them at first,
and then afterwards, say second, for the lawyer to have
illustrated points out of the history of the originals, dusting
the particular bust&mdash;that was all the development
the thing would bear. Dickens killed them. The only
really well <i>executed</i> scenes are the riverside ones; the
escape in particular is excellent; and I may add, the
capture of the two convicts at the beginning. Miss Havisham
is, probably, the worst thing in human fiction. But
Wemmick I like; and I like Trabb&rsquo;s boy; and Mr. Wopsle
as Hamlet is splendid.</p>

<p>The weather here is greatly improved, and I hope in
three days to be in the chalet. That is, if I get some
money to float me there.</p>

<p>I hope you are all right again, and will keep better.
The month of March is past its mid career; it must soon
begin to turn toward the lamb; here it has already begun
to do so; and I hope milder weather will pick you up.
Wogg has eaten a forpet of rice and milk, his beard is
streaming, his eyes wild. I am besieged by demands of
work from America.</p>

<p>The Â£50 has just arrived; many thanks; I am now at
ease.&mdash;Ever your affectionate son, <i>pro</i> Cassandra, Wogg

<p>My head is singing with <i>Otto</i>; for the first two weeks
I wrote and revised and only finished IV chapters: last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
week, I have just drafted straight ahead, and I have just
finished Chapter XI. It will want a heap of oversight
and much will not stand, but the pace is good; about
28 Cornhill pp. drafted in seven days, and almost all of
it dialogue&mdash;indeed I may say all, for I have dismissed
the rest very summarily in the draft: one can always
tickle at that. At the same rate, the draft should be
finished in ten days more; and then I shall have the
pleasure of beginning again at the beginning. Ah damned
job! I have no idea whether or not Otto will be good.
It is all pitched pretty high and stilted; almost like the
Arabs, at that; but of course there is love-making in
Otto, and indeed a good deal of it. I sometimes feel very

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;I am one of the lowest of the&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s understood. I received the copy, excellently
written, with I think only one slip from first to last. I
have struck out two, and added five or six; so they now
number forty-five; when they are fifty, they shall out on
the world. I have not written a letter for a cruel time;
I have been, and am, so busy, drafting a long story (for
me, I mean), about a hundred Cornhill pages, or say about
as long as the Donkey book: <i>Prince Otto</i> it is called, and is,
at the present hour, a sore burthen but a hopeful. If I
had him all drafted, I should whistle and sing. But no:
then I&rsquo;ll have to rewrite him; and then there will be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
publishers, alas! But some time or other, I shall whistle
and sing, I make no doubt.</p>

<p>I am going to make a fortune, it has not yet begun,
for I am not yet clear of debt; but as soon as I can, I
begin upon the fortune. I shall begin it with a halfpenny,
and it shall end with horses and yachts and all
the fun of the fair. This is the first real grey hair in my
character: rapacity has begun to show, the greed of the
protuberant guttler. Well, doubtless, when the hour
strikes, we must all guttle and protube. But it comes
hard on one who was always so willow-slender and as
careless as the daisies.</p>

<p>Truly I am in excellent spirits. I have crushed through
a financial crisis; Fanny is much better; I am in excellent
health, and work from four to five hours a day&mdash;from
one to two above my average, that is; and we all
dwell together and make fortunes in the loveliest house
you ever saw, with a garden like a fairy story, and a view
like a classical landscape.</p>

<p>Little? Well, it is not large. And when you come
to see us, you will probably have to bed at the hotel,
which is hard by. But it is Eden, madam, Eden and
Beulah and the Delectable Mountains and Eldorado and
the Hesperidean Isles and Bimini.<a name="FnAnchor_3" id="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>We both look forward, my dear friend, with the greatest
eagerness to have you here. It seems it is not to be
this season: but I appoint you with an appointment for
next season. You cannot see us else: remember that.
Till my health has grown solid like an oak-tree, till my
fortune begins really to spread its boughs like the same
monarch of the woods (and the acorn, ay de mi! is not
yet planted), I expect to be a prisoner among the
palms.</p>

<p>Yes, it is like old times to be writing you from the
Riviera, and after all that has come and gone, who can
predict anything? How fortune tumbles men about!

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Gilder&rdquo; in the following is of course the late R. W. Gilder, for
many years the admirable editor of the Century Magazine.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Chalet la Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>April</i> 1883].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;I am very guilty; I should have
written to you long ago; and now, though it must be
done, I am so stupid that I can only boldly recapitulate.
A phrase of three members is the outside of my syntax.</p>

<p>First, I like the <i>Rover</i> better than any of your other
verse. I believe you are right, and can make stories
in verse. The last two stanzas and one or two in the
beginning&mdash;but the two last above all&mdash;I thought excellent.
I suggest a pursuit of the vein. If you want a
good story to treat, get the <i>Memoirs of the Chevalier Johnstone</i>,
and do his passage of the Tay; it would be excellent:
the dinner in the field, the woman he has to follow, the
dragoons, the timid boatmen, the brave lasses. It would go
like a charm; look at it, and you will say you owe me one.</p>

<p>Second, Gilder asking me for fiction, I suddenly took
a great resolve, and have packed off to him my new work,
<i>The Silverado Squatters</i>. I do not for a moment suppose
he will take it; but pray say all the good words you
can for it. I should be awfully glad to get it taken. But
if it does not mean dibbs at once, I shall be ruined for
life. Pray write soon and beg Gilder your prettiest for
a poor gentleman in pecuniary sloughs.</p>

<p>Fourth, next time I am supposed to be at death&rsquo;s door

write to me like a Christian, and let not your correspondence
attend on business.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

much do you suppose? I believe it would be an excellent
jest to keep the answer till my next letter. For two
cents I would do so. Shall I? Anyway, I&rsquo;ll turn the
page first. No&mdash;well&mdash;A hundred pounds, all alive, O!
A hundred jingling, tingling, golden, minted quid. Is not
this wonderful? Add that I have now finished, in draft,
the fifteenth chapter of my novel, and have only five before
me, and you will see what cause of gratitude I have.</p>

<p>The weather, to look at the per contra sheet, continues
vomitable; and Fanny is quite out of sorts. But, really,
with such cause of gladness, I have not the heart to be
dispirited by anything. My child&rsquo;s verse book is finished,
dedication and all, and out of my hands&mdash;you may tell
Cummy; <i>Silverado</i> is done, too, and cast upon the waters;
and this novel so near completion, it does look as if I

time, as Lloyd will go soon with the letters on his way to
his tutor, Louis Robert (!!!!), with whom he learns
Latin in French, and French, I suppose, in Latin, which
seems to me a capital education. He, Lloyd, is a great
bicycler already, and has been long distances; he is
most new-fangled over his instrument, and does not
willingly converse on other subjects.</p>

<p>Our lovely garden is a prey to snails; I have gathered
about a bushel, which, not having the heart to slay, I
steal forth withal and deposit near my neighbour&rsquo;s garden
wall. As a case of casuistry, this presents many points
of interest. I loathe the snails, but from loathing to
actual butchery, trucidation of multitudes, there is still
a step that I hesitate to take. What, then, to do with
them? My neighbour&rsquo;s vineyard, pardy! It is a rich,
villa, pleasure-garden of course; if it were a peasant&rsquo;s
patch, the snails, I suppose, would have to
perish.</p>

<p>The weather these last three days has been much
better, though it is still windy and unkind. I keep splendidly
well, and am cruelly busy, with mighty little time
even for a walk. And to write at all, under such pressure,
must be held to lean to virtue&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>My financial prospects are shining. O if the health
will hold, I should easily support myself.&mdash;Your ever
affectionate son,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;I enclose the receipt and the corrections.
As for your letter and Gilder&rsquo;s, I must take
an hour or so to think; the matter much importing&mdash;to
me. The Â£40 was a heavenly thing.</p>

<p>I send the MS. by Henley, because he acts for me in
all matters, and had the thing, like all my other books,
in his detention. He is my unpaid agent&mdash;an admirable
arrangement for me, and one that has rather more than
doubled my income on the spot.</p>

<p>If I have been long silent, think how long you were
so and blush, sir, blush.</p>

<p>I was rendered unwell by the arrival of your cheque,
and, like Pepys, &ldquo;my hand still shakes to write of it.&rdquo;
To this grateful emotion, and not to D.T., please attribute
the raggedness of my hand.</p>

<p>This year I should be able to live and keep my family
on my own earnings, and that in spite of eight months
and more of perfect idleness at the end of last and beginning
of this. It is a sweet thought.</p>

<p>This spot, our garden and our view, are sub-celestial.
I sing daily with my Bunyan, that great bard,</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;I dwell already the next door to Heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you could see my roses, and my aloes, and my fig-marigolds,
and my olives, and my view over a plain, and
my view of certain mountains as graceful as Apollo, as
severe as Zeus, you would not think the phrase exaggerated.</p>

<p>It is blowing to-day a <i>hot</i> mistral, which is the devil
or a near connection of his.</p>

<p>This to catch the post.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;The night giveth advice, generally
bad advice; but I have taken it. And I have written
direct to Gilder to tell him to keep the book<a name="FnAnchor_4" id="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> back and
go on with it in November at his leisure. I do not know
if this will come in time; if it doesn&rsquo;t, of course things
will go on in the way proposed. The Â£40, or, as I prefer
to put it, the 1000 francs, has been such a piercing sun-ray
as my whole grey life is gilt withal. On the back of
it I can endure. If these good days of Longman and the
Century only last, it will be a very green world, this that
we dwell in and that philosophers miscall. I have no
taste for that philosophy; give me large sums paid on
the receipt of the MS. and copyright reserved, and what
do I care about the non-bÃ«ent? Only I know it can&rsquo;t
last. The devil always has an imp or two in every
house, and my imps are getting lively. The good
lady, the dear, kind lady, the sweet, excellent lady,
Nemesis, whom alone I adore, has fixed her wooden
eye upon me. I fall prone; spare me, Mother Nemesis!
But catch her!</p>

<p>I must now go to bed; for I have had a whoreson
influenza cold, and have to lie down all day, and get up
only to meals and the delights, June delights, of business
correspondence.</p>

<p>You said nothing about my subject for a poem. Don&rsquo;t
you like it? My own fishy eye has been fixed on it for
prose, but I believe it could be thrown out finely in verse,
and hence I resign and pass the hand. Twig the compliment?&mdash;Yours

<p>&ldquo;Tushery&rdquo; had been a name in use between Stevenson and
Mr. Henley for romances of the <i>Ivanhoe</i> type. He now applies it to
his own tale of the Wars of the Roses, <i>The Black Arrow</i>, written
for Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s Young Folks, of which the office was in Red
Lion Court.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>HyÃ¨res, May</i> 1883.]</p>

<p>... The influenza has busted me a good deal; I
have no spring, and am headachy. So, as my good Red
Lion Courier begged me for another Butcher&rsquo;s Boy&mdash;I
turned me to&mdash;what thinkest &rsquo;ou?&mdash;to Tushery, by the
mass! Ay, friend, a whole tale of tushery. And every
tusher tushes me so free, that may I be tushed if the whole
thing is worth a tush. <i>The Black Arrow: A Tale of
Tunstall Forest</i> is his name: tush! a poor thing!</p>

<p>Will <i>Treasure Island</i> proofs be coming soon, think you?</p>

<p>I will now make a confession. It was the sight of
your maimed strength and masterfulness that begot John
Silver in <i>Treasure Island</i>. Of course, he is not in any
other quality or feature the least like you; but the idea
of the maimed man, ruling and dreaded by the sound,
was entirely taken from you.</p>

<p>Otto is, as you say, not a thing to extend my public
on. It is queer and a little, little bit free; and some of
the parties are immoral; and the whole thing is not a
romance, nor yet a comedy; nor yet a romantic comedy;
but a kind of preparation of some of the elements of all
three in a glass jar. I think it is not without merit, but
I am not always on the level of my argument, and some
parts are false, and much of the rest is thin; it is more a
triumph for myself than anything else; for I see, beyond
it, better stuff. I have nine chapters ready, or almost
ready, for press. My feeling would be to get it placed
anywhere for as much as could be got for it, and rather
in the shadow, till one saw the look of it in print.&mdash;Ever

I have not had the pluck to answer: a shower of small
troubles having fallen in, or troubles that may be very
large.</p>

<p>I have had to incur a huge vague debt for cleaning
sewers; our house was (of course) riddled with hidden
cesspools, but that was infallible. I have the fever, and
feel the duty to work very heavy on me at times; yet
go it must. I have had to leave <i>Fontainebleau</i>, when three
hours would finish it, and go full-tilt at tushery for a while.
But it will come soon.</p>

<p>I think I can give you a good article on Hokusai; but
that is for afterwards; <i>Fontainebleau</i> is first in hand.</p>

<p>By the way, my view is to give the <i>Penny Whistles</i> to
Crane or Greenaway. But Crane, I think, is likeliest; he
is a fellow who, at least, always does his best.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;Snatches in return for yours; for this
little once, I&rsquo;m well to windward of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span></p>

<p>Seventeen chapters of <i>Otto</i> are now drafted, and finding
I was working through my voice and getting screechy, I
have turned back again to rewrite the earlier part. It
has, I do believe, some merit: of what order, of course,
I am the last to know; and, triumph of triumphs, my wife&mdash;my
wife who hates and loathes and slates my women&mdash;admits
a great part of my Countess to be on the spot.</p>

<p>Yes, I could borrow, but it is the joy of being before
the public, for once. Really, Â£100 is a sight more than
<i>Treasure Island</i> is worth.</p>

<p>The reason of my <i>dÃ¨che</i>? Well, if you begin one
house, have to desert it, begin another, and are eight
months without doing any work, you will be in a <i>dÃ¨che</i>
too. I am not in a <i>dÃ¨che</i>, however; <i>distingue</i>&mdash;I would
fain distinguish; I am rather a swell, but <i>not solvent</i>.
At a touch the edifice, <i>Ã¦dificium</i>, might collapse. If my
creditors began to babble around me, I would sink with
a slow strain of music into the crimson west. The difficulty
in my elegant villa is to find oil, <i>oleum</i>, for the dam
axles. But I&rsquo;ve paid my rent until September; and
beyond the chemist, the grocer, the baker, the doctor, the
gardener, Lloyd&rsquo;s teacher, and the great chief creditor
Death, I can snap my fingers at all men. Why will people
spring bills on you? I try to make &rsquo;em charge me at the
moment; they won&rsquo;t, the money goes, the debt remains.&mdash;The
Required Play is in the <i>Merry Men</i>.</p>

<p class="rt">Q. E. F.</p>

<p class="pt2">I thus render honour to your <i>flair</i>; it came on me of
a clap; I do not see it yet beyond a kind of sunset glory.
But it&rsquo;s there: passion, romance, the picturesque, involved:
startling, simple, horrid: a sea-pink in sea-froth!
<i>S&rsquo;agit de la dÃ©senterrer.</i> &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cries a buried
masterpiece.</p>

<p>Once I see my way to the year&rsquo;s end, clear, I turn to
plays; till then I grind at letters; finish <i>Otto</i>; write, say,
a couple of my <i>Traveller&rsquo;s Tales</i>; and then, if all my
ships come home, I will attack the drama in earnest. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
cannot mix the skeins. Thus, though I&rsquo;m morally sure
there is a play in <i>Otto</i>, I dare not look for it: I shoot
straight at the story.</p>

<p>As a story, a comedy, I think <i>Otto</i> very well constructed;
the echoes are very good, all the sentiments
change round, and the points of view are continually,
and, I think (if you please), happily contrasted. None
of it is exactly funny, but some of it is smiling.</p>

depth of novelty and worth in any art! and O that I am
privileged to swim and shoulder through such oceans!
Could one get out of sight of land&mdash;all in the blue? Alas
not, being anchored here in flesh, and the bonds of logic
being still about us.</p>

<p>But what a great space and a great air there is in these
small shallows where alone we venture! and how new
each sight, squall, calm, or sunrise! An art is a fine
fortune, a palace in a park, a band of music, health, and
physical beauty; all but love&mdash;to any worthy practiser.
I sleep upon my art for a pillow; I waken in my art; I
am unready for death, because I hate to leave it. I love
my wife, I do not know how much, nor can, nor shall,
unless I lost her; but while I can conceive my being
widowed, I refuse the offering of life without my art. I <i>am</i>
not but in my art; it is me; I am the body of it merely.</p>

<p>During the height of the ProvenÃ§al summer, for July and part
of August, Stevenson went with his wife to the Baths of Royat in
Auvergne (travelling necessarily by way of Clermont-Ferrand).
His parents joined them at Royat for part of their visit. This and

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res. But just now writing from<br />
Clermont-Ferrand, July</i> 5, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. HADDON</span>,&mdash;Your note with its piece of excellent
news duly reached me. I am delighted to hear of
your success: selfishly so; for it is pleasant to see that
one whom I suppose I may call an admirer is no fool. I
wish you more and more prosperity, and to be devoted
to your art. An art is the very gist of life; it grows
with you; you will never weary of an art at which you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
fervently and superstitiously labour. Superstitiously: I
mean, think more of it than it deserves; be blind to its
faults, as with a wife or father; forget the world in a
technical trifle. The world is very serious; art is the
cure of that, and must be taken very lightly; but to take
art lightly, you must first be stupidly owlishly in earnest
over it. When I made Casimir say &ldquo;Tiens&rdquo; at the end,
I made a blunder. I thought it was what Casimir would
have said and I put it down. As your question shows, it
should have been left out. It was a &ldquo;patch&rdquo; of realism,
and an anti-climax. Beware of realism; it is the devil;
&rsquo;tis one of the means of art, and now they make it the end!
And such is the farce of the age in which a man lives, that
we all, even those of us who most detest it, sin by realism.</p>

<p>Notes for the student of any art.</p>

<p>1. Keep an intelligent eye upon <i>all</i> the others. It is
only by doing so that you come to see what Art is: Art
is the end common to them all, it is none of the points by
which they differ.</p>

<p>2. In this age beware of realism.</p>

<p>3. In your own art, bow your head over technique.
Think of technique when you rise and when you go to
bed. Forget purposes in the meanwhile; get to love
technical processes; to glory in technical successes; get
to see the world entirely through technical spectacles, to
see it entirely in terms of what you can do. Then when you
have anything to say, the language will be apt and copious.</p>

<p>My health is better.</p>

<p>I have no photograph just now; but when I get one
you shall have a copy. It will not be like me; sometimes
I turn out a capital, fresh bank clerk; once I came
out the image of Runjeet Singh; again the treacherous
sun has fixed me in the character of a travelling evangelist.
It&rsquo;s quite a lottery; but whatever the next venture
proves to be, soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, you shall
have a proof. Reciprocate. The truth is I have no
appearance; a certain air of disreputability is the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
constant character that my face presents: the rest change
like water. But still I am lean, and still disreputable.</p>

<p>Cling to your youth. It is an artistic stock in trade.
Don&rsquo;t give in that you are ageing, and you won&rsquo;t age. I
have exactly the same faults and qualities still; only
a little duller, greedier and better tempered; a little
less tolerant of pain and more tolerant of tedium. The
last is a great thing for life but&mdash;query?&mdash;a bad endowment
for art?</p>

<p>Another note for the art student.</p>

<p>4. See the good in other people&rsquo;s work; it will never
be yours. See the bad in your own, and don&rsquo;t cry about
it; it will be there always. Try to use your faults; at
any rate use your knowledge of them, and don&rsquo;t run
your head against stone walls. Art is not like theology;
nothing is forced. You have not to represent the world.
You have to represent only what you can represent with
pleasure and effect, and the only way to find out what
that is is by technical exercise.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="to">To Jules Simoneau</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>HyÃ¨res or Royat, Summer</i> 1883.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND SIMONEAU</span>,&mdash;It would be difficult to
tell how glad I was to get your letter with your good
news and kind remembrances, it did my heart good to
the bottom. I shall never forget the good time we had
together, the many long talks, the games of chess, the
flute on an occasion, and the excellent food. Now I am
in clover, only my health a mere ruined temple; the ivy
grows along its shattered front, otherwise, I have no
wish that is not fulfilled: a beautiful large garden, a fine
view of plain, sea and mountain; a wife that suits me
down to the ground, and a barrel of good Beaujolais.
To this I must add that my books grow steadily more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
popular, and if I could only avoid illness I should be well
to do for money, as it is, I keep pretty near the wind.
Have I other means? I doubt it. I saw FranÃ§ois here;
and it was in some respects sad to see him, pining in the
ungenial life and not, I think, very well pleased with his
relatives. The young men, it is true, adored him, but
his niece tried to pump me about what money I had,
with an effrontery I was glad to disappoint. How he
spoke of you I need not tell you. He is your true friend,
dear Simoneau, and your ears should have tingled when
we met, for we talked of little but yourself.</p>

<p>The papers you speak about are past dates but I will
send you a paper from time to time, as soon as I am able
to go out again. We were both well pleased to hear of
your marriage, and both Mrs. Stevenson and myself beg
to be remembered with the kindest wishes to Mrs. Simoneau.
I am glad you have done this. All races are better away
from their own country; but I think you French improve
the most of all. At home, I like you well enough, but
give me the Frenchman abroad! Had you stayed at
home, you would probably have acted otherwise. Consult
your consciousness, and you will think as I do. How
about a law condemning the people of every country to
be educated in another, to change sons in short? Should
we not gain all around? Would not the Englishman
unlearn hypocrisy? Would not the Frenchman learn to
put some heart into his friendships? I name what strikes
me as the two most obvious defects of the two nations.
The French might also learn to be a little less rapacious
to women and the English to be a little more honest.</p>

<p>Indeed their merits and defects make a balance.</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="80%" summary="Contents">

<tr><td class="tc1">The English.</td>  <td class="tc1">The French.</td></tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span></p>

<p class="noind">There is my table, not at all the usual one, but yes, I
think you will agree with it. And by travel, each race
can cure much of its defects and acquire much of the
others&rsquo; virtues. Let us say that you and I are complete!
You are anyway: I would not change a hair of you.
The Americans hold the English faults: dishonest and
hypocrites, perhaps not so strongly but still to the exclusion
of others. It is strange that such mean defects
should be so hard to eradicate, after a century of separation,
and so great an admixture of other blood.</p>

<p>Your stay in Mexico must have been interesting indeed:
and it is natural you should be so keen against the Church
on this side, we have a painful exhibition of the other
side: the <i>libre-penseur</i> a mere priest without the sacraments,
the narrowest tyranny of intolerance popular, and
in fact a repetition in the XIXth century of theological
ill-feeling minus the sermons. We have speeches instead.
I met the other day one of the new lay schoolmasters of
France; a pleasant cultivated man, and for some time
listened to his ravings. &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are
like Louis Quatorze, you wish to drive out of France
all who do not agree with you.&rdquo; I thought he would
protest; not he!&mdash;&ldquo;Oui, Monsieur,&rdquo; was his answer.
And that is the cause of liberty and free thought! But
the race of man was born tyrannical; doubtless Adam
beat Eve, and when all the rest are dead the last man will
be found beating the last dog. In the land of Padre d. R.
you see the old tyranny still active on its crutches; in this
land, I begin to see the new, a fat fellow, out of leading-strings
and already killing flies.</p>

<p>This letter drones along unprofitably enough. Let me
put a period to my divagations. Write again soon, and
let me hear good news of you, and I will try to be more
quick of answer.</p>

<p>And with the best wishes to yourself and all your
family, believe me, your sincere friend,</p>

<p>The persons mentioned below in the third paragraph are cousins
of the writer and playmates of his childhood; two of them, christened
Lewis like himself after their Balfour grandfather, had been nicknamed
after their birthplaces &ldquo;Delhi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cramond&rdquo; to avoid

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CUMMY</span>,&mdash;Yes, I own I am a real bad correspondent,
and am as bad as can be in most directions.</p>

<p>I have been adding some more poems to your book.
I wish they would look sharp about it; but, you see,
they are trying to find a good artist to make the illustrations,
without which no child would give a kick for it.
It will be quite a fine work, I hope. The dedication is a
poem too, and has been quite a long while written, but I
do not mean you to see it till you get the book; keep the
jelly for the last, you know, as you would often recommend
in former days, so now you can take your own
medicine.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to hear you have been so poorly; I
have been very well; it used to be quite the other way,
used it not? Do you remember making the whistle at
Mount Chessie? I do not think it <i>was</i> my knife; I
believe it was yours; but rhyme is a very great monarch,
and goes before honesty, in these affairs at least. Do you
remember, at Warriston, one autumn Sunday, when the
beech nuts were on the ground, seeing heaven open? I
would like to make a rhyme of that, but cannot.</p>

<p>Is it not strange to think of all the changes: Bob,
Cramond, Delhi, Minnie, and Henrietta, all married, and
fathers and mothers, and your humble servant just the
one point better off? And such a little while ago all
children together! The time goes swift and wonderfully
even; and if we are no worse than we are, we should be
grateful to the power that guides us. For more than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
generation I have now been to the fore in this rough world,
and been most tenderly helped, and done cruelly wrong,
and yet escaped; and here I am still, the worse for wear,
but with some fight in me still, and not unthankful&mdash;no,
surely not unthankful, or I were then the worst of
human things!</p>

<p>My little dog is a very much better child in every
way, both more loving and more amiable; but he is not
fond of strangers, and is, like most of his kind, a great,
specious humbug.</p>

<p>Fanny has been ill, but is much better again; she now
goes donkey rides with an old woman, who compliments
her on her French. That old woman&mdash;seventy odd&mdash;is
in a parlous spiritual state.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, in the new sixpenny illustrated magazine,
Wogg&rsquo;s picture is to appear: this is a great honour!
And the poor soul, whose vanity would just explode if
he could understand it, will never be a bit the wiser!&mdash;With
much love, in which Fanny joins, believe me, your
affectionate boy,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;I have now leisurely read your
volume; pretty soon, by the way, you will receive one
of mine.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant, instructive, and scholarly volume.
The three best being, quite out of sight&mdash;Crashaw, Otway,

them; but perhaps Crashaw is the most brilliant.</p>

<p>Your Webster is not my Webster; nor your Herrick
my Herrick. On these matters we must fire a gun to

impossible. They are two of my favourite authors:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
Herrick above all: I suppose they are two of yours. Well,

and we can but agree to differ, but still with gratitude to
our entertainers, like two guests at the same dinner, one

<p>The other papers are all interesting, adequate, clear,

you may be well pleased to have so finished, and will
do you much good. The Crashaw is capital: capital;
I like the taste of it. Preface clean and dignified. The

five touches of preciosity, which I regret.</p>

<p class="to">To Miss Ferrier</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Soon after he was settled again at HyÃ¨res, Stevenson had a great
shock in the death of one of the oldest and most intimate of his
friends of Edinburgh days, Mr. James Walter Ferrier (see the essay
<i>Old Mortality</i> in <i>Memories and Portraits</i>). It is in accordance with
the expressed wish of this gentleman&rsquo;s surviving sister that publicity
is given to the following letters:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>Sept.</i> 1883].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS FERRIER</span>,&mdash;They say Walter is gone.
You, who know how I have neglected him, will conceive
my remorse. I had another letter written; when I
heard he was worse, I promised myself to wake up for
the last time. Alas, too late!</p>

<p>My dear Walter, set apart that terrible disease, was,
in his right mind, the best and gentlest gentleman. God
knows he would never intentionally hurt a soul.</p>

<p>Well, he is done with his troubles and out of his long
sickness, and I dare say is glad to be at peace and out of
the body, which in him seemed the enemy of the fine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
kind spirit. He is the first friend I have ever lost, and I
find it difficult to say anything and fear to intrude upon
your grief. But I had to try to tell you how much I
shared it.</p>

<p>Could you get any one to tell me particulars? Do
not write yourself of course&mdash;I do not mean that; but
some one else.</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, September</i> 19, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR BOY</span>,&mdash;Our letters vigorously cross: you will ere
this have received a note to Coggie: God knows what
was in it.</p>

<p>It is strange, a little before the first word you sent me&mdash;so
late&mdash;kindly late, I know and feel&mdash;I was thinking
in my bed, when I knew you I had six friends&mdash;Bob I
had by nature; then came the good James Walter&mdash;with
all his failings&mdash;the <i>gentleman</i> of the lot, alas to sink
so low, alas to do so little, but now, thank God, in his
quiet rest; next I found Baxter&mdash;well do I remember
telling Walter I had unearthed &ldquo;a W.S. that I thought
would do&rdquo;&mdash;it was in the Academy Lane, and he questioned
me as to the Signet&rsquo;s qualifications; fourth came
Simpson; somewhere about the same time, I began to get
intimate with Jenkin; last came Colvin. Then, one
black winter afternoon, long Leslie Stephen, in his velvet
jacket, met me in the Spec. by appointment, took me
over to the infirmary, and in the crackling, blighting gas-light
showed me that old head whose excellent representation
I see before me in the photograph. Now when a man
has six friends, to introduce a seventh is usually hopeless.
Yet when you were presented, you took to them and they
to you upon the nail. You must have been a fine fellow;
but what a singular fortune I must have had in my six
friends that you should take to all. I don&rsquo;t know if it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
good Latin, most probably not: but this is enscrolled
before my eyes for Walter: <i>Tandem e nubibus in apricum
properat</i>. Rest, I suppose, I know, was all that remained;
but O to look back, to remember all the mirth, all the
kindness, all the humorous limitations and loved defects
of that character; to think that he was young with me,
sharing that weather-beaten, Fergussonian youth, looking
forward through the clouds to the sunburst; and now
clean gone from my path, silent&mdash;well, well. This has
been a strange awakening. Last night, when I was alone
in the house, with the window open on the lovely still
night, I could have sworn he was in the room with me;
I could show you the spot; and, what was very curious,
I heard his rich laughter, a thing I had not called to mind
for I know not how long.</p>

<p>I see his coral waistcoat studs that he wore the first
time he dined in my house; I see his attitude, leaning
back a little, already with something of a portly air, and
laughing internally. How I admired him! And now in
the West Kirk.</p>

<p>I am trying to write out this haunting bodily sense of
absence; besides, what else should I write of?</p>

<p>Yes, looking back, I think of him as one who was good,
though sometimes clouded. He was the only gentle one
of all my friends, save perhaps the other Walter. And
he was certainly the only modest man among the lot.
He never gave himself away; he kept back his secret;
there was always a gentle problem behind all. Dear,
dear, what a wreck; and yet how pleasant is the retrospect!
God doeth all things well, though by what strange,
solemn, and murderous contrivances!</p>

<p>It is strange: he was the only man I ever loved who
did not habitually interrupt. The fact draws my own
portrait. And it is one of the many reasons why I count
myself honoured by his friendship. A man like you <i>had</i>
to like me; you could not help yourself; but Ferrier was
above me, we were not equals; his true self humoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
and smiled paternally upon my failings, even as I humoured
and sorrowed over his.</p>

<p>Well, first his mother, then himself, they are gone:
&ldquo;in their resting graves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I come to think of it, I do not know what I said
to his sister, and I fear to try again. Could you send
her this? There is too much both about yourself and
me in it; but that, if you do not mind, is but a mark of
sincerity. It would let her know how entirely, in the
mind of (I suppose) his oldest friend, the good, true Ferrier
obliterates the memory of the other, who was only his
&ldquo;lunatic brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge of this for me, and do as you please; anyway,
I will try to write to her again; my last was some kind
of scrawl that I could not see for crying. This came
upon me, remember, with terrible suddenness; I was surprised
by this death; and it is fifteen or sixteen years
since first I saw the handsome face in the Spec. I made
sure, besides, to have died first. Love to you, your wife,
and her sisters.&mdash;Ever yours, dear boy,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt2">I never knew any man so superior to himself as poor
James Walter. The best of him only came as a vision,
like Corsica from the Corniche. He never gave his
measure either morally or intellectually. The curse was
on him. Even his friends did not know him but by fits.
I have passed hours with him when he was so wise, good,
and sweet, that I never knew the like of it in any other.
And for a beautiful good humour he had no match. I
remember breaking in upon him once with a whole red-hot
story (in my worst manner), pouring words upon him
by the hour about some truck not worth an egg that had
befallen me; and suddenly, some half hour after, finding
that the sweet fellow had some concern of his own of
infinitely greater import, that he was patiently and
smilingly waiting to consult me on. It sounds nothing;
but the courtesy and the unselfishness were perfect. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
makes me rage to think how few knew him, and how many
had the chance to sneer at their better.</p>

<p>Well, he was not wasted, that we know; though if
anything looked liker irony than this fitting of a man
out with these rich qualities and faculties to be wrecked
and aborted from the very stocks, I do not know the
name of it. Yet we see that he has left an influence;
the memory of his patient courtesy has often checked
me in rudeness; has it not you?</p>

<p>You can form no idea of how handsome Walter was.
At twenty he was splendid to see; then, too, he had
the sense of power in him, and great hopes; he looked
forward, ever jesting of course, but he looked to see himself
where he had the right to expect. He believed in
himself profoundly; but <i>he never disbelieved in others</i>.
To the roughest Highland student he always had his
fine, kind, open dignity of manner; and a good word
behind his back.</p>

<p>The last time that I saw him before leaving for America&mdash;it
was a sad blow to both of us. When he heard I was
leaving, and that might be the last time we might meet&mdash;it
almost was so&mdash;he was terribly upset, and came
round at once. We sat late, in Baxter&rsquo;s empty house,
where I was sleeping. My dear friend Walter Ferrier:
O if I had only written to him more! if only one of us
in these last days had been well! But I ever cherished
the honour of his friendship, and now when he is gone,
I know what I have lost still better. We live on, meaning
to meet; but when the hope is gone, the pang comes.</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, 26th September</i> 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;It appears a bolt from Transatlantica
is necessary to produce four lines from you. It is
not flattering; but as I was always a bad correspondent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
&rsquo;tis a vice to which I am lenient. I give you to know,
however, that I have already twice (this makes three
times) sent you what I please to call a letter, and received
from you in return a subterfuge&mdash;or nothing....</p>

<p>My present purpose, however, which must not be
postponed, is to ask you to telegraph to the Americans.</p>

<p>After a summer of good health of a very radiant order,
toothache and the death of a very old friend, which came
upon me like a thunderclap, have rather shelved my
powers. I stare upon the paper, not write. I wish I could
write like your Sculptors; yet I am well aware that I
should not try in that direction. A certain warmth (tepid
enough) and a certain dash of the picturesque are my poor
essential qualities; and if I went fooling after the too
classical, I might lose even these. But I envied you
that page.</p>

<p>I am, of course, deep in schemes; I was so ever.
Execution alone somewhat halts. How much do you make
per annum, I wonder? This year, for the first time, I
shall pass Â£300; I may even get halfway to the next milestone.
This seems but a faint remuneration; and the
devil of it is, that I manage, with sickness, and moves,
and education, and the like, to keep steadily in front of
my income. However, I console myself with this, that
if I were anything else under God&rsquo;s Heaven, and had the
same crank health, I should make an even zero. If I
had, with my present knowledge, twelve months of my
old health, I would, could, and should do something neat.
As it is, I have to tinker at my things in little sittings;
and the rent, or the butcher, or something, is always
calling me off to rattle up a pot-boiler. And then comes
a back-set of my health, and I have to twiddle my fingers
and play patience.</p>

<p>Well, I do not complain, but I do envy strong health
where it is squandered. Treasure your strength, and
may you never learn by experience the profound <i>ennui</i>
and irritation of the shelved artist. For then, what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
life? All that one has done to make one&rsquo;s life effective
then doubles the itch of inefficiency.</p>

<p>I trust also you may be long without finding out the
devil that there is in a bereavement. After love it is the
one great surprise that life preserves for us. Now I don&rsquo;t
think I can be astonished any more.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To Miss Ferrier</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, 30th Sept. 1883.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS FERRIER</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged to
you for your letter and was interested by all you told
me. Yes, I know it is better for him to be gone, and
what you say helps me to realise that it is so&mdash;I did not
know how much he had suffered; it is so that we are
cured of life. I am a little afraid to write or think
much of Walter just yet; as I have not quite recovered
the news and I have my work and my wife to
think of.</p>

<p>Some day soon when the sharpness passes off (if it
does) I must try to write some more of what he was: he
was so little understood. I don&rsquo;t suppose any one knew
him better than I did. But just now it is difficult to
think of him. For you I do mourn indeed, and admire
your courage: the loss is terrible. I have no portrait
of him. Is there one? If so please let me have it: if
it has to be copied please let it be.</p>

<p>Henley seems to have been as good to dear Walter as
he is to all. That introduction was a good turn I did to
both. It seems so strange for a friendship to begin all
these years ago with so much mirth and now to end with
this sorrow. Our little lives are moments in the wake of
the eternal silence: but how crowded while they last.
His has gone down in peace.</p>

<p>I was not certainly the best companion for Walter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
but I do believe I was the best he had. In these early
days he was not fortunate in friends&mdash;looking back I see
most clearly how much we both wanted a man of riper
wisdom. We had no religion between the pair of us&mdash;that
was the flaw. How very different was our last
intimacy in Gladstone Terrace. But youth must learn&mdash;looking
back over these wasted opportunities, I must try
rather to remember what I did right, than to bewail the
much that I left undone and knew not how to do. I see
that even you have allowed yourself to have regrets.
Dear Miss Ferrier, sure you were his angel. We all had
something to be glad of, in so far as we had understood
and loved and perhaps a little helped the gentle spirit;
but you may certainly be proud. He always loved you;
and I remember in his worst days spoke of you with great
affection; a thing unusual with him; for he was walking
very wild and blind and had no true idea whether of
himself or life. The lifting afterwards was beautiful and
touching. Dear Miss Ferrier I have given your kind
messages to my wife who feels for you and reciprocates
the hope to meet. When it may come off I know not.
I feel almost ashamed to say that I keep better, I feel
as if like Mrs. Leslie &ldquo;you must hate me for it&rdquo;&mdash;still I
can very easily throw back whether by fatigue or want
of care, and I do not like to build plans for my return
to my own land. Is there no chance of your coming
hereabouts? Though we cannot in our small and disorderly
house offer a lady a room, one can be got close
by and we can offer possible board and a most lovely
little garden for a lounge. Please remember me kindly to
your brother John and Sir A. and Lady Grant and
believe me with hearty sympathy&mdash;Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt2">I was rejoiced to hear he never doubted of my love,
but I must cure my hate of correspondence. This has
been a sharp lesson.</p>

<i>Otto</i>: a letter is a curst distraction. About 100 pp. are
near fit for publication; I am either making a spoon or
spoiling the horn of a Caledonian bull, with that airy
potentate. God help me, I bury a lot of labour in that
principality; and if I am not greatly a gainer, I am a
great loser and a great fool. However, <i>sursum corda</i>;
faint heart never writ romance.</p>

<p>Your Dumas I think exquisite; it might even have
been stronglier said: the brave old godly pagan, I adore
his big footprints on the earth.</p>

<p>Have you read Meredith&rsquo;s <i>Love in the Valley</i>? It got
me, I wept; I remembered that poetry existed.</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I propose if they (Lippincotts) will let me wait till next
Autumn, and go when it is safest, to accept Â£450 with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
Â£100 down; but it is now too late to go this year. November
and December are the months when it is safest; and
the back of the season is broken. I shall gain much
knowledge by the trip; this I look upon as one of the
main inducements.</p>

I had lately sent him.</p>

<p><span class="scs">COLVIN, COLVIN, COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Yours received; also interesting
copy of <i>P. Whistles</i>. &ldquo;In the multitude of councillors
the Bible declares there is wisdom,&rdquo; said my great-uncle,
&ldquo;but I have always found in them distraction.&rdquo;
It is extraordinary how tastes vary: these proofs have
been handed about, it appears, and I have had several
letters; and&mdash;distraction. Ã†sop: the Miller and the Ass.</p>

<p>Notes on details:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. I love the occasional trochaic line; and so did
many excellent writers before me.</p>

<p>2. If you don&rsquo;t like <i>A Good Boy</i>, I do.</p>

<p>3. In <i>Escape at Bedtime</i>, I found two suggestions.
&ldquo;Shove&rdquo; for &ldquo;above&rdquo; is a correction of the press; it
was so written. &ldquo;Twinkled&rdquo; is just the error; to the
child the stars appear to be there; any word that suggests
illusion is a horror.</p>

<p>4. I don&rsquo;t care; I take a different view of the
vocative.</p>

<p>5. Bewildering and childering are good enough for me.
These are rhymes, jingles; I don&rsquo;t go for eternity and
the three unities.</p>

<p>I will delete some of those condemned, but not all. I
don&rsquo;t care for the name Penny Whistles; I sent a sheaf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
to Henley when I sent &rsquo;em. But I&rsquo;ve forgot the
others. I would just as soon call &rsquo;em &ldquo;Rimes for
Children&rdquo; as anything else. I am not proud nor
particular.</p>

<p>Your remarks on the <i>Black Arrow</i> are to the point. I
am pleased you liked Crookback; he is a fellow whose
hellish energy has always fixed my attention. I wish
Shakespeare had written the play after he had learned
some of the rudiments of literature and art rather than
before. Some day, I will re-tickle the Sable Missile, and
shoot it, <i>moyennant finances</i>, once more into the air; I
can lighten it of much, and devote some more attention
to Dick o&rsquo; Gloucester. It&rsquo;s great sport to write
tushery.</p>

<p>By this I reckon you will have heard of my proposed
excursiolorum to the Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece,
and kindred sites. If the excursiolorum goes on, that
is if <i>moyennant finances</i> comes off, I shall write to beg
you to collect introductiolorums for me.</p>

<p>Distinguo: 1. <i>Silverado</i> was not written in America,
but in Switzerland&rsquo;s icy mountains. 2. What you read is
the bleeding and disembowelled remains of what I wrote.
3. The good stuff is all to come&mdash;so I think. &ldquo;The Sea
Fogs,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hunter&rsquo;s Family,&rdquo; &ldquo;Toils and Pleasures&rdquo;&mdash;<i>belles

<p class="pt2">O!&mdash;Seeley is too clever to live, and the book a gem.
But why has he read too much Arnold? Why will he
avoid&mdash;obviously avoid&mdash;fine writing up to which he has
led? This is a winking, curled-and-oiled, ultra-cultured,
Oxford-don sort of an affectation that infuriates my
honest soul. &ldquo;You see&rdquo;&mdash;they say&mdash;&ldquo;how unbombastic
<i>we</i> are; we come right up to eloquence, and, when it&rsquo;s
hanging on the pen, dammy, we scorn it!&rdquo; It is literary
Deronda-ism. If you don&rsquo;t want the woman, the image,
or the phrase, mortify your vanity and avoid the appearance
of wanting them.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The first paragraph of the following refers to contributions of
R. L. S. to the Magazine of Art under Mr. Henley&rsquo;s editorship:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res [Autumn 1883].</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;Glad you like <i>Fontainebleau</i>. I am going
to be the means, under heaven, of aÃ«rating or literating
your pages. The idea that because a thing is a picture-book
all the writing should be on the wrong tack is <i>triste</i>
but widespread. Thus <i>Hokusai</i> will be really a gossip on
convention, or in great part. And the Skelt will be as
like a Charles Lamb as I can get it. The writer should
write, and not illustrate pictures: else it&rsquo;s bosh....</p>

<p>Your remarks about the ugly are my eye. Ugliness is
only the prose of horror. It is when you are not able to
write <i>Macbeth</i> that you write <i>ThÃ©rÃ¨se Raquin</i>. Fashions
are external: the essence of art only varies in so far as
fashion widens the field of its application; art is a mill
whose thirlage, in different ages, widens and contracts;
but, in any case and under any fashion, the great man
produces beauty, terror, and mirth, and the little man
produces cleverness (personalities, psychology) instead of
beauty, ugliness instead of terror, and jokes instead of
mirth. As it was in the beginning, is now, and shall be
ever, world without end. Amen!</p>

<p>And even as you read, you say, &ldquo;Of course, <i>quelle
rengaine</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="to">To W. H. Low</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Manhattan mentioned below is the name of a short-lived New
York magazine, the editor of which had asked through Mr. Low
for a contribution from R. L. S.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, October</i> [1883].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;... Some day or other, in Cassell&rsquo;s
Magazine of Art, you will see a paper which will interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
you, and where your name appears. It is called <i>Fontainebleau:
Village Communities of Artists</i>, and the signature
of R. L. Stevenson will be found annexed.</p>

<p>Please tell the editor of Manhattan the following
secrets for me: 1<i>st</i>, That I am a beast; 2<i>nd</i>, that I owe
him a letter; 3<i>rd</i>, that I have lost his, and cannot recall
either his name or address; 4<i>th</i>, that I am very deep
in engagements, which my absurd health makes it hard
for me to overtake; but 5<i>th</i>, that I will bear him in mind;
6<i>th</i> and last, that I am a brute.</p>

<p>My address is still the same, and I live in a most sweet
corner of the universe, sea and fine hills before me, and a
rich variegated plain; and at my back a craggy hill, loaded
with vast feudal ruins. I am very quiet; a person passing
by my door half startles me; but I enjoy the most aromatic
airs, and at night the most wonderful view into a
moonlit garden. By day this garden fades into nothing,
overpowered by its surroundings and the luminous distance;
but at night and when the moon is out, that
garden, the arbour, the flight of stairs that mount the
artificial hillock, the plumed blue gum-trees that hang
trembling, become the very skirts of Paradise. Angels I
know frequent it; and it thrills all night with the flutes
of silence. Damn that garden;&mdash;and by day it is gone.</p>

<p>Continue to testify boldly against realism. Down with
Dagon, the fish god! All art swings down towards imitation,
in these days, fatally. But the man who loves art with
wisdom sees the joke; it is the lustful that tremble and respect
her ladyship; but the honest and romantic lovers of
the Muse can see a joke and sit down to laugh with Apollo.</p>

<p>The prospect of your return to Europe is very agreeable;
and I was pleased by what you said about your
parents. One of my oldest friends died recently, and
this has given me new thoughts of death. Up to now
I had rather thought of him as a mere personal enemy
of my own; but now that I see him hunting after my
friends, he looks altogether darker. My own father is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
well; and Henley, of whom you must have heard me
speak, is in a questionable state of health. These things
are very solemn, and take some of the colour out of life.
It is a great thing, after all, to be a man of reasonable
honour and kindness. Do you remember once consulting
me in Paris whether you had not better sacrifice honesty
to art; and how, after much confabulation, we agreed that
your art would suffer if you did? We decided better than
we knew. In this strange welter where we live, all hangs
together by a million filaments; and to do reasonably
well by others, is the first pre-requisite of art. Art is a
virtue; and if I were the man I should be, my art would
rise in the proportion of my life.</p>

<p>If you were privileged to give some happiness to your
parents, I know your art will gain by it. <i>By God it will!</i>
&mdash;<i>Sic subscribitur</i>,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To R. A. M. Stevenson</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>October</i> 1883].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BOB</span>,&mdash;Yes, I got both your letters at Lyons,
but have been since then decading in several steps.
Toothache; fever; Ferrier&rsquo;s death; lung. Now it is
decided I am to leave to-morrow, penniless, for Nice to
see Dr. Williams.</p>

<p>I was much struck by your last. I have written a
breathless note on Realism for Henley; a fifth part of
the subject hurriedly touched, which will show you how
my thoughts are driving. You are now at last beginning
to think upon the problems of executive, plastic art, for
you are now for the first time attacking them. Hitherto
you have spoken and thought of two things&mdash;technique
and the <i>ars artium</i>, or common background of all arts.
Studio work is the real touch. That is the genial error
of the present French teaching. Realism I regard as a
mere question of method. The &ldquo;brown foreground,&rdquo; &ldquo;old
mastery,&rdquo; and the like, ranking with villanelles, as technical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
sports and pastimes. Real art, whether ideal or realistic,
addresses precisely the same feeling, and seeks the same
qualities&mdash;significance or charm. And the same&mdash;very
same&mdash;inspiration is only methodically differentiated
according as the artist is an arrant realist or an arrant
idealist. Each, by his own method, seeks to save and
perpetuate the same significance or charm; the one by
suppressing, the other by forcing, detail. All other idealism
is the brown foreground over again, and hence only
art in the sense of a game, like cup and ball. All other
realism is not art at all&mdash;but not at all. It is, then, an
insincere and showy handicraft.</p>

<p>Were you to re-read some Balzac, as I have been
doing, it would greatly help to clear your eyes. He was
a man who never found his method. An inarticulate
Shakespeare, smothered under forcible-feeble detail. It
is astounding to the riper mind how bad he is, how feeble,
how untrue, how tedious; and, of course, when he surrendered
to his temperament, how good and powerful.
And yet never plain nor clear. He could not consent to
be dull, and thus became so. He would leave nothing
undeveloped, and thus drowned out of sight of land amid
the multitude of crying and incongruous details. There
is but one art&mdash;to omit! O if I knew how to omit, I
would ask no other knowledge. A man who knew how
to omit would make an <i>Iliad</i> of a daily paper.</p>

<p>Your definition of seeing is quite right. It is the first
part of omission to be partly blind. Artistic sight is
judicious blindness. Sam Bough must have been a jolly
blind old boy. He would turn a corner, look for one-half
or quarter minute, and then say, &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll do, lad.&rdquo; Down
he sat, there and then, with whole artistic plan, scheme
of colour, and the like, and begin by laying a foundation
of powerful and seemingly incongruous colour on the
block. He saw, not the scene, but the water-colour sketch.
Every artist by sixty should so behold nature. Where
does he learn that? In the studio, I swear. He goes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
nature for facts, relations, values&mdash;material; as a man,
before writing a historical novel, reads up memoirs. But
it is not by reading memoirs that he has learned the selective
criterion. He has learned that in the practice of his
art; and he will never learn it well, but when disengaged
from the ardent struggle of immediate representation, of
realistic and <i>ex facto</i> art. He learns it in the crystallisation
of day-dreams; in changing, not in copying, fact; in the
pursuit of the ideal, not in the study of nature. These
temples of art are, as you say, inaccessible to the realistic
climber. It is not by looking at the sea that you get</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;The multitudinous seas incarnadine,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">nor by looking at Mont Blanc that you find</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;And visited all night by troops of stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">A kind of ardour of the blood is the mother of all this;
and according as this ardour is swayed by knowledge and
seconded by craft, the art expression flows clear, and significance
and charm, like a moon rising, are born above the
barren juggle of mere symbols.</p>

<p>The painter must study more from nature than the
man of words. By why? Because literature deals with
men&rsquo;s business and passions which, in the game of life,
we are irresistibly obliged to study; but painting with
relations of light, and colour, and significances, and form,
which, from the immemorial habit of the race, we pass
over with an unregardful eye. Hence this crouching upon
camp-stools, and these crusts.<a name="FnAnchor_6" id="FnAnchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> But neither one nor other
is a part of art, only preliminary studies.</p>

<p>I want you to help me to get people to understand
that realism is a method, and only methodic in its consequences;
when the realist is an artist, that is, and supposing
the idealist with whom you compare him to be anything
but a <i>farceur</i> and a <i>dilettante</i>. The two schools of working
do, and should, lead to the choice of different subjects. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
that is a consequence, not a cause. See my chaotic note,
which will appear, I fancy, in November in Henley&rsquo;s sheet.</p>

<p>Poor Ferrier, it bust me horrid. He was, after you,
the oldest of my friends.</p>

<p>I am now very tired, and will go to bed having prelected
freely. Fanny will finish.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Some pages of MS. exist in which the writer at this time attempted
to re-cast and expand a portion of the <i>Lay Morals</i> of 1879. A
letter written some days earlier to his father, and partly quoted in
Mr. Graham Balfour&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> (ed. 1906, p. 209), explains his purpose.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, 12th October 1883.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;I have just lunched; the day is
exquisite, the air comes through the open window rich
with odour, and I am by no means spiritually minded.
Your letter, however, was very much valued, and has been
read oftener than once. What you say about yourself I
was glad to hear; a little decent resignation is not only
becoming a Christian, but is likely to be excellent for the
health of a Stevenson. To fret and fume is undignified,
suicidally foolish, and theologically unpardonable; we are
here not to make, but to tread predestined, pathways; we
are the foam of a wave, and to preserve a proper equanimity
is not merely the first part of submission to God,
but the chief of possible kindnesses to those about us. I
am lecturing myself, but you also. To do our best is one
part, but to wash our hands smilingly of the consequence
is the next part, of any sensible virtue.</p>

<p>I have come, for the moment, to a pause in my moral
works; for I have many irons in the fire, and I wish to
finish something to bring coin before I can afford to go
on with what I think doubtfully to be a duty. It is a
most difficult work; a touch of the parson will drive off
those I hope to influence; a touch of overstrained laxity,
besides disgusting, like a grimace, may do harm. Nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
that I have ever seen yet speaks directly and efficaciously
to young men; and I do hope I may find the art and
wisdom to fill up a gap. The great point, as I see it, is
to ask as little as possible, and meet, if it may be, every
view or absence of view; and it should be, must be, easy.
Honesty is the one desideratum; but think how hard a
one to meet. I think all the time of Ferrier and myself;
these are the pair that I address. Poor Ferrier, so much
a better man than I, and such a temporal wreck. But
the thing of which we must divest our minds is to look
partially upon others; all is to be viewed; and the creature
judged, as he must be by his Creator, not dissected
through a prism of morals, but in the unrefracted ray.
So seen, and in relation to the almost omnipotent surroundings,
who is to distinguish between F. and such a
man as Dr. Candlish, or between such a man as David
Hume and such an one as Robert Burns? To compare
my poor and good Walter with myself is to make me
startle; he, upon all grounds above the merely expedient,
was the nobler being. Yet wrecked utterly ere the full
age of manhood; and the last skirmishes so well fought,
so humanly useless, so pathetically brave, only the leaps
of an expiring lamp. All this is a very pointed instance.
It shuts the mouth. I have learned more, in some ways,
from him than from any other soul I ever met; and he,
strange to think, was the best gentleman, in all kinder
senses, that I ever knew.&mdash;Ever your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="to">To W. H. Low</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The paper referred to at the beginning of the second paragraph
is one on R. L. S. in the Century Magazine, the first seriously critical
notice, says Mr. Low, which appeared of him in the States.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, Oct.</i> 23, 1883.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;<i>C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;un bon camarade</i>; and I am
much obliged to you for your two letters and the inclosure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
Times are a lityle changed with all of us since the ever
memorable days of Lavenue: hallowed be his name!
hallowed his old Fleury!&mdash;of which you did not see&mdash;I
think&mdash;as I did&mdash;the glorious apotheosis: advanced on a
Tuesday to three francs, on the Thursday to six, and on
Friday swept off, holus bolus, for the proprietor&rsquo;s private
consumption. Well, we had the start of that proprietor.
Many a good bottle came our way, and was, I think,
worthily made welcome.</p>

<p>I am pleased that Mr. Gilder should like my literature;
and I ask you particularly to thank Mr. Bunner (have I
the name right?) for his notice, which was of that friendly,
headlong sort that really pleases an author like what the
French call a &ldquo;shake-hands.&rdquo; It pleased me the more
coming from the States, where I have met not much
recognition, save from the buccaneers, and above all from
pirates who misspell my name. I saw my book advertised
in a number of the Critic as the work of one R. L.
Stephenson; and, I own, I boiled. It is so easy to know
the name of the man whose book you have stolen; for
there it is, at full length, on the title-page of your booty.
But no, damn him, not he! He calls me Stephenson.
These woes I only refer to by the way, as they set a higher
value on the Century notice.</p>

<p>I am now a person with an established ill-health&mdash;a
wife&mdash;a dog possessed with an evil, a Gadarene spirit&mdash;a
chalet on a hill, looking out over the Mediterranean&mdash;a
certain reputation&mdash;and very obscure finances. Otherwise,
very much the same, I guess; and were a bottle of
Fleury a thing to be obtained, capable of developing
theories along with a fit spirit even as of yore. Yet I
now draw near to the Middle Ages; nearly three years
ago, that fatal Thirty struck; and yet the great work is
not yet done&mdash;not yet even conceived. But so, as one
goes on, the wood seems to thicken, the footpath to narrow,
and the House Beautiful on the hill&rsquo;s summit to draw
further and further away. We learn, indeed, to use our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
means; but only to learn, along with it, the paralysing
knowledge that these means are only applicable to two
or three poor commonplace motives. Eight years ago, if
I could have slung ink as I can now, I should have thought
myself well on the road after Shakespeare; and now&mdash;I
find I have only got a pair of walking-shoes and not yet
begun to travel. And art is still away there on the mountain
summit. But I need not continue; for, of course,
this is your story just as much as it is mine; and, strange
to think, it was Shakespeare&rsquo;s too, and Beethoven&rsquo;s, and
Phidias&rsquo;s. It is a blessed thing that, in this forest of
art, we can pursue our woodlice and sparrows, <i>and not
catch them</i>, with almost the same fervour of exhilaration
as that with which Sophocles hunted and brought down
the Mastodon.</p>

<p>Tell me something of your work, and your wife.&mdash;My
dear fellow, I am yours ever,</p>

<p class="sc rt">R. L. Stevenson.</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>By this time <i>Treasure Island</i> was out in book form, and the
following is in reply to some reflections on its seamanship which
had been conveyed to him through Mr. Henley:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, November</i> 1883.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash; ... Of course, my seamanship is
jimmy: did I not beseech you I know not how often to
find me an ancient mariner&mdash;and you, whose own wife&rsquo;s
own brother is one of the ancientest, did nothing for me?
As for my seamen, did Runciman ever know eighteenth
century Buccaneers? No? Well, no more did I. But I
have known and sailed with seamen too, and lived and
eaten with them; and I made my put-up shot in no great
ignorance, but as a put-up thing has to be made, <i>i.e.</i> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
be coherent and picturesque, and damn the expense. Are
they fairly lively on the wires? Then, favour me with
your tongues. Are they wooden, and dim, and no sport?
Then it is I that am silent, otherwise not. The work,
strange as it may sound in the ear, is not a work of realism.
The next thing I shall hear is that the etiquette is wrong
in Otto&rsquo;s Court! With a warrant, and I mean it to be
so, and the whole matter never cost me half a thought.
I make these paper people to please myself, and Skelt,
and God Almighty, and with no ulterior purpose. Yet
am I mortal myself; for, as I remind you, I begged for a
supervising mariner. However, my heart is in the right
place. I have been to sea, but I never crossed the threshold
of a court; and the courts shall be the way I want &rsquo;em.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to think I owe you the review that pleased
me best of all the reviews I ever had; the one I liked
best before that was &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s on the <i>Arabians</i>. These two
are the flowers of the collection, according to me. To
live reading such reviews and die eating ortolans&mdash;sich
is my aspiration.</p>

<p>Whenever you come you will be equally welcome. I
am trying to finish <i>Otto</i> ere you shall arrive, so as to take
and be able to enjoy a well-earned&mdash;O yes, a well-earned&mdash;holiday.
Longman fetched by <i>Otto</i>: is it a spoon or
a spoilt horn? Momentous, if the latter; if the former,
a spoon to dip much praise and pudding, and to give, I
do think, much pleasure. The last part, now in hand,
much smiles upon me.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;You must not blame me too much
for my silence; I am over head and ears in work, and do

at <i>Silverado</i> proofs, which I have worked over again to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
a tremendous extent; cutting, adding, rewriting, until
some of the worst chapters of the original are now, to
my mind, as good as any. I was the more bound to make
it good, as I had such liberal terms; it&rsquo;s not for want
of trying if I have failed.</p>

<p>I got your letter on my birthday; indeed, that was
how I found it out about three in the afternoon, when
postie comes. Thank you for all you said. As for my
wife, that was the best investment ever made by man;
but &ldquo;in our branch of the family&rdquo; we seem to marry
well. I, considering my piles of work, am wonderfully
well; I have not been so busy for I know not how long.
I hope you will send me the money I asked however, as
I am not only penniless, but shall remain so in all human
probability for some considerable time. I have got in
the mass of my expectations; and the Â£100 which is to
float us on the new year cannot come due till <i>Silverado</i> is
all ready; I am delaying it myself for the moment; then
will follow the binders and the travellers and an infinity
of other nuisances; and only at the last, the jingling-tingling.</p>

<p>Do you know that <i>Treasure Island</i> has appeared? In
the November number of Henley&rsquo;s Magazine, a capital
number anyway, there is a funny publisher&rsquo;s puff of it
for your book; also a bad article by me. Lang dotes on
<i>Treasure Island</i>: &ldquo;Except <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;I never liked any romance so much.&rdquo; I will
inclose the letter though. The Bogue is angelic, although
very dirty. It has rained&mdash;at last! It was jolly cold when
the rain came.</p>

<p>I was overjoyed to hear such good news of my father.
Let him go on at that!&mdash;Ever your affectionate,</p>

the whereabouts of the misguided gentleman. He

be felt by a bereaved and uneasy family.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This is to a cousin who had been one of his favourite playmates
in childhood, and had recognised some allusions in the proof slips
of the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i> (the piece called <i>A Pirate Story</i>).</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>November</i> 1883].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENRIETTA</span>,&mdash;Certainly; who else would they
be? More by token, on that particular occasion, you
were sailing under the title of Princess Royal; I, after a
furious contest, under that of Prince Alfred; and Willie,
still a little sulky, as the Prince of Wales. We were all
in a buck basket about half-way between the swing and
the gate; and I can still see the Pirate Squadron heave
in sight upon the weather bow.</p>

<p>I wrote a piece besides on Giant Bunker; but I was
not happily inspired, and it is condemned. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll
try again; he was a horrid fellow, Giant Bunker! and
some of my happiest hours were passed in pursuit of him.
You were a capital fellow to play: how few there were
who could! None better than yourself. I shall never
forget some of the days at Bridge of Allan; they were
one golden dream. See &ldquo;A Good Boy&rdquo; in the <i>Penny
Whistles</i>, much of the sentiment of which is taken direct
from one evening at B. of A. when we had had a great
play with the little Glasgow girl. Hallowed be that fat
book of fairy tales! Do you remember acting the Fair
One with Golden Locks? What a romantic drama!
Generally speaking, whenever I think of play, it is pretty
certain that you will come into my head. I wrote a paper
called <i>Child&rsquo;s Play</i> once, where, I believe, you or Willie
would recognise things....</p>

<p>Surely Willie is just the man to marry; and if his wife
wasn&rsquo;t a happy woman, I think I could tell her who was
to blame. Is there no word of it? Well, these things are
beyond arrangement; and the wind bloweth where it
listeth&mdash;which, I observe, is generally towards the west in
Scotland. Here it prefers a south-easterly course, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
called the Mistral&mdash;usually with an adjective in front.
But if you will remember my yesterday&rsquo;s toothache and
this morning&rsquo;s crick, you will be in a position to choose
an adjective for yourself. Not that the wind is unhealthy;
only when it comes strong, it is both very high and very
cold, which makes it the d-v-l. But as I am writing to
a lady, I had better avoid this topic; winds requiring a
great scope of language.</p>

<p class="to">To Miss Ferrier</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>November</i> 22, 1883].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MISS FERRIER</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for the photograph.
It is&mdash;well, it is like most photographs. The sun is an artist
of too much renown; and, at any rate, we who knew Walter
&ldquo;in the brave days of old&rdquo; will be difficult to please.</p>

<p>I was inexpressibly touched to get a letter from some
lawyers as to some money. I have never had any account
with my friends; some have gained and some lost; and
I should feel there was something dishonest in a partial
liquidation even if I could recollect the facts, <i>which I
cannot</i>. But the fact of his having put aside this memorandum
touched me greatly.</p>

<p>The mystery of his life is great. Our chemist in this
place, who had been at Malvern, recognised the picture.
You may remember Walter had a romantic affection for all
pharmacies? and the bottles in the window were for him a
poem? He said once that he knew no pleasure like driving
through a lamplit city, waiting for the chemists to go by.</p>

<p>All these things return now.</p>

<p>He had a pretty full translation of Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Ã†sthetic
Letters</i>, which we read together, as well as the second part
of <i>Faust</i>, in Gladstone Terrace, he helping me with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
German. There is no keepsake I should more value than
the MS. of that translation. They were the best days I
ever had with him, little dreaming all would so soon be
over. It needs a blow like this to convict a man of mortality
and its burthen. I always thought I should go by
myself; not to survive. But now I feel as if the earth
were undermined, and all my friends have lost one thickness
of reality since that one passed. Those are happy
who can take it otherwise; with that I found things all
beginning to dislimn. Here we have no abiding city, and
one felt as though he had&mdash;and O too much acted.</p>

<p>But if you tell me, he did not feel my silence. However,
he must have done so; and my guilt is irreparable now.
I thank God at least heartily that he did not resent it.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Sir Alexander and Lady Grant,
to whose care I will address this. When next I am in
Edinburgh I will take flowers, alas! to the West Kirk.
Many a long hour we passed in graveyards, the man who
has gone and I&mdash;or rather not that man&mdash;but the beautiful,
genial, witty youth who so betrayed him.&mdash;Dear
Miss Ferrier, I am yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This refers to some dispute which had arisen with an editor (I

nickname &ldquo;Fastidious Brisk,&rdquo; from Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Every Man out

inappropriately as I always thought.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, Autumn</i> 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;You know your own business best;
but I wish your honesty were not so warfaring. These
conflicts pain Lucretian sitters on the shore; and one
wonders&mdash;one wonders&mdash;wonders and whimpers. I do not
say my attitude is noble; but is yours conciliatory? I
revere Salvini, but I shall never see him&mdash;nor anybody&mdash;play
again. That is all a matter of history, heroic history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
to me. Were I in London, I should be the liker Tantalus&mdash;no
more. But as for these quarrels: in not many years
shall we not all be clay-cold and safe below ground, you
with your loud-mouthed integrity, I with my fastidious
briskness&mdash;and&mdash;with all their faults and merits, swallowed
in silence. It seems to me, in ignorance of cause, that
when the dustman has gone by, these quarrellings will
prick the conscience. Am I wrong? I am a great sinner;
so, my brave friend, are you; the others also. Let us
a little imitate the divine patience and the divine sense
of humour, and smilingly tolerate those faults and virtues
that have so brief a period and so intertwined a being.</p>

<p>I fear I was born a parson; but I live very near upon
the margin (though, by your leave, I may outlive you
all!), and too much rigour in these daily things sounds to
me like clatter on the kitchen dishes. If it might be&mdash;could
it not be smoothed? This very day my father writes
me he has gone to see, upon his deathbed, an old friend
to whom for years he has not spoken or written. On his
deathbed; no picking up of the lost stitches; merely to
say: my little fury, my spotted uprightness, after having
split our lives, have not a word of quarrel to say more.
And the same post brings me the news of another&mdash;War!
Things in this troubled medium are not so clear, dear
Henley; there are faults upon all hands; and the end
comes, and Ferrier&rsquo;s grave gapes for us all.</p>

<p class="to">To W. H. Low</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, Var, 13th December</i> 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash; ... I was much pleased with what
you said about my work. Ill-health is a great handicapper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
in the race. I have never at command that press
of spirits that are necessary to strike out a thing red-hot.
<i>Silverado</i> is an example of stuff worried and pawed about,
God knows how often, in poor health, and you can see
for yourself the result: good pages, an imperfect fusion,
a certain languor of the whole. Not, in short, art. I
have told Roberts to send you a copy of the book when
it appears, where there are some fair passages that will
be new to you. My brief romance, <i>Prince Otto</i>&mdash;far my
most difficult adventure up to now&mdash;is near an end. I
have still one chapter to write <i>de fond en comble</i>, and three
or four to strengthen or recast. The rest is done. I do
not know if I have made a spoon, or only spoiled a horn;
but I am tempted to hope the first. If the present bargain
hold, it will not see the light of day for some thirteen
months. Then I shall be glad to know how it strikes you.
There is a good deal of stuff in it, both dramatic and, I
think, poetic; and the story is not like these purposeless
fables of to-day, but is, at least, intended to stand firm
upon a base of philosophy&mdash;or morals&mdash;as you please. It
has been long gestated, and is wrought with care. <i>Enfin,
nous verrons.</i> My labours have this year for the first time
been rewarded with upwards of Â£350; that of itself, so
base we are! encourages me; and the better tenor of
my health yet more.&mdash;Remember me to Mrs. Low, and
believe me, yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Thomas Stevenson</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, December</i> 20, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;I do not know which of us is to
blame; I suspect it is you this time. The last accounts
of you were pretty good, I was pleased to see; I am, on
the whole, very well&mdash;suffering a little still from my fever
and liver complications, but better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span></p>

<p>I have just finished re-reading a book, which I counsel
you above all things <i>not</i> to read, as it has made me very
ill, and would make you worse&mdash;Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Scott</i>. It is
worth reading, as all things are from time to time that
keep us nose to nose with fact; though I think such
reading may be abused, and that a great deal of life is
better spent in reading of a light and yet chivalrous strain.
Thus, no Waverley novel approaches in power, blackness,
bitterness, and moral elevation to the diary and Lockhart&rsquo;s
narrative of the end; and yet the Waverley novels
are better reading for every day than the Life. You may
take a tonic daily, but not phlebotomy.</p>

<p>The great double danger of taking life too easily, and
taking it too hard, how difficult it is to balance that!
But we are all too little inclined to faith; we are all,
in our serious moments, too much inclined to forget that
all are sinners, and fall justly by their faults, and therefore
that we have no more to do with that than with the
thundercloud; only to trust, and do our best, and wear
as smiling a face as may be for others and ourselves. But
there is no royal road among this complicated business.
Hegel the German got the best word of all philosophy
with his antinomies: the contrary of everything is its
postulate. That is, of course, grossly expressed, but gives
a hint of the idea, which contains a great deal of the mysteries
of religion, and a vast amount of the practical wisdom
of life. For your part, there is no doubt as to your duty&mdash;to
take things easy and be as happy as you can, for
your sake, and my mother&rsquo;s, and that of many besides.
Excuse this sermon.&mdash;Ever your loving son,</p>

father; he is not grateful enough; he is like Fanny; his

a stone; whose son is better, and, after so many fears
to the contrary, I dare to say, a credit to him; whose
business is arranged; whose marriage is a picture&mdash;what
I should call resignation in such a case as his would be
to &ldquo;take down his fiddle and play as lood as ever he could.&rdquo;
That and nought else. And now, you dear old pious
ingrate, on this Christmas morning, think what your
mercies have been; and do not walk too far before your

<p class="rt">[<i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i>] <i>last Sunday of</i> &rsquo;83.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I give my father up. I give him
a parable: that the Waverley novels are better reading
for every day than the tragic Life. And he takes it backside
foremost, and shakes his head, and is gloomier than
ever. Tell him that I give him up. I don&rsquo;t want no
such a parent. This is not the man for my money. I
do not call that by the name of religion which fills a man
with bile. I write him a whole letter, bidding him beware
of extremes, and telling him that his gloom is gallows-worthy;
and I get back an answer&mdash;Perish the thought
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span></p>

<p>Here am I on the threshold of another year, when,
according to all human foresight, I should long ago have
been resolved into my elements; here am I, who you
were persuaded was born to disgrace you&mdash;and, I will do
you the justice to add, on no such insufficient grounds&mdash;no
very burning discredit when all is done; here am I
married, and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of
the first order, A1 at Lloyd&rsquo;s. There is he, at his not
first youth, able to take more exercise than I at thirty-three,
and gaining a stone&rsquo;s weight, a thing of which I
am incapable. There are you; has the man no gratitude?
There is Smeoroch<a name="FnAnchor_8" id="FnAnchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>: is he blind? Tell him from me
that all this is</p>

<p class="center scs">NOT THE TRUE BLUE!</p>

<p class="noind">I will think more of his prayers when I see in him a spirit
of <i>praise</i>. Piety is a more childlike and happy attitude
than he admits. Martha, Martha, do you hear the knocking
at the door? But Mary was happy. Even the
Shorter Catechism, not the merriest epitome of religion,
and a work exactly as pious although not quite so true
as the multiplication table&mdash;even that dry-as-dust epitome
begins with a heroic note. What is man&rsquo;s chief end?
Let him study that; and ask himself if to refuse to enjoy
God&rsquo;s kindest gifts is in the spirit indicated. Up,
Dullard! It is better service to enjoy a novel than to
mump.</p>

<p>I have been most unjust to the Shorter Catechism, I
perceive. I wish to say that I keenly admire its merits
as a performance; and that all that was in my mind was
its peculiarly unreligious and unmoral texture; from which
defect it can never, of course, exercise the least influence
on the minds of children. But they learn fine style and
some austere thinking unconsciously.&mdash;Ever your loving

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res-les-Palmiers, Var,
January</i> 1 (1884).</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR PEOPLE</span>,&mdash;A Good New Year to you. The
year closes, leaving me with Â£50 in the bank, owing no man
nothing, Â£100 more due to me in a week or so, and Â£150
more in the course of the month; and I can look back on
a total receipt of Â£465, 0s. 6d. for the last twelve months!</p>

<p>And yet I am not happy!</p>

<p>Yet I beg! Here is my beggary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="list">
<p>1. Sellar&rsquo;s Trial.</p>
<p>2. George Borrow&rsquo;s Book about Wales.</p>
<p>3. My Grandfather&rsquo;s Trip to Holland.</p>
<p>4. And (but this is, I fear, impossible) the Bell Rock Book.</p>
</div>

<p>When I think of how last year began, after four months
of sickness and idleness, all my plans gone to water, myself
starting alone, a kind of spectre, for Nice&mdash;should I not
be grateful? Come, let us sing unto the Lord!</p>

<p>Nor should I forget the expected visit, but I will not
believe in that till it befall; I am no cultivator of disappointments,
&rsquo;tis a herb that does not grow in my garden;
but I get some good crops both of remorse and gratitude.
The last I can recommend to all gardeners; it grows best
in shiny weather, but once well grown, is very hardy;
it does not require much labour; only that the husbandman
should smoke his pipe about the flower-plots and
admire God&rsquo;s pleasant wonders. Winter green (otherwise
known as Resignation, or the &ldquo;false gratitude plant&rdquo;)
springs in much the same soil; is little hardier, if at all;
and requires to be so dug about and dunged, that there
is little margin left for profit. The variety known as the
Black Winter green (H. V. Stevensoniana) is rather for
ornament than profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;John, do you see that bed of resignation?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
doin&rsquo; bravely, sir.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;John, I will not have it in my
garden; it flatters not the eye and comforts not the
stomach; root it out.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, I ha&rsquo;e seen o&rsquo; them that
rase as high as nettles; gran&rsquo; plants!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What then?
Were they as tall as alps, if still unsavoury and bleak,
what matters it? Out with it, then; and in its place
put Laughter and a Good Conceit (that capital home evergreen),
and a bush of Flowering Piety&mdash;but see it be the
flowering sort&mdash;the other species is no ornament to any
gentleman&rsquo;s Back Garden.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The allusions in the second paragraph are to the commanders
in the Nile campaigns of those years.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, 9th March</i> 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR S. C.</span>,&mdash;You will already have received a not
very sane note from me; so your patience was rewarded&mdash;may
I say, your patient silence? However, now comes
a letter, which on receipt, I thus acknowledge.</p>

<p>I have already expressed myself as to the political
aspect. About Grahame, I feel happier; it does seem to
have been really a good, neat, honest piece of work. We
do not seem to be so badly off for commanders: Wolseley
and Roberts, and this pile of Woods, Stewarts, Alisons,
Grahames, and the like. Had we but <span class="sc">ONE</span> statesman
on any side of the house!</p>

<p>Two chapters of <i>Otto</i> do remain: one to rewrite, one
to create; and I am not yet able to tackle them. For
me it is my chief o&rsquo; works; hence probably not so for
others, since it only means that I have here attacked the
greatest difficulties. But some chapters towards the end:
three in particular&mdash;I do think come off. I find them
stirring, dramatic, and not unpoetical. We shall see,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
however; as like as not, the effort will be more obvious
than the success. For, of course, I strung myself hard
to carry it out. The next will come easier, and possibly
be more popular. I believe in the covering of much paper,
each time with a definite and not too difficult artistic
purpose; and then, from time to time, drawing oneself
up and trying, in a superior effort, to combine the facilities
thus acquired or improved. Thus one progresses. But,
mind, it is very likely that the big effort, instead of being
the masterpiece, may be the blotted copy, the gymnastic
exercise. This no man can tell; only the brutal and
licentious public, snouting in Mudie&rsquo;s wash-trough, can
return a dubious answer.</p>

<p>I am to-day, thanks to a pure heaven and a beneficent,
loud-talking, antiseptic mistral, on the high places as to
health and spirits. Money holds out wonderfully. Fanny
has gone for a drive to certain meadows which are now
one sheet of jonquils: sea-bound meadows, the thought
of which may freshen you in Bloomsbury. &ldquo;Ye have
been fresh and fair, Ye have been filled with flowers&rdquo;&mdash;I
fear I misquote. Why do people babble? Surely
Herrick, in his true vein, is superior to Martial himself,
though Martial is a very pretty poet.</p>

<p>Did you ever read St. Augustine? The first chapters
of the <i>Confessions</i> are marked by a commanding genius:
Shakespearian in depth. I was struck dumb, but, alas!
when you begin to wander into controversy, the poet
drops out. His description of infancy is most seizing.
And how is this: &ldquo;Sed majorum nugae negotia vocantur;
puerorum autem talia cum sint puniuntur a majoribus.&rdquo;
Which is quite after the heart of R. L. S. See also his
splendid passage about the &ldquo;luminosus limes amicitiae&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;nebulae de limosa concupiscentia carnis&rdquo;; going
on &ldquo;<i>Utrumque</i> in confuso aestuabat et rapiebat imbecillam
aetatem per abrupta cupiditatum.&rdquo; That &ldquo;Utrumque&rdquo;
is a real contribution to life&rsquo;s science. Lust <i>alone</i> is but a
pigmy; but it never, or rarely, attacks us single-handed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span></p>

<p>Do you ever read (to go miles off, indeed) the incredible
Barbey d&rsquo;AurÃ©villy? A psychological Poe&mdash;to be for a
moment Henley. I own with pleasure I prefer him with
all his folly, rot, sentiment, and mixed metaphors, to the
whole modern school in France. It makes me laugh when
it&rsquo;s nonsense; and when he gets an effect (though it&rsquo;s
still nonsense and mere PoÃ«ry, not poesy) it wakens me.
<i>Ce qui ne meurt pas</i> nearly killed me with laughing, and
left me&mdash;well, it left me very nearly admiring the old ass.
At least, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing one feels one couldn&rsquo;t do.
The dreadful moonlight, when they all three sit silent in
the room&mdash;by George, sir, it&rsquo;s imagined&mdash;and the brief
scene between the husband and wife is all there. <i>Quant
au fond</i>, the whole thing, of course, is a fever dream, and
worthy of eternal laughter. Had the young man broken
stones, and the two women been hard-working honest
prostitutes, there had been an end of the whole immoral
and baseless business: you could at least have respected
them in that case.</p>

<p>I also read <i>Petronius Arbiter</i>, which is a rum work, not
so immoral as most modern works, but singularly silly.
I tackled some Tacitus too. I got them with a dreadful
French crib on the same page with the text, which helps
me along and drives me mad. The French do not even
try to translate. They try to be much more classical than
the classics, with astounding results of barrenness and
tedium. Tacitus, I fear, was too solid for me. I liked
the war part; but the dreary intriguing at Rome was
too much.</p>

<p class="to">To Mr. Dick</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This correspondent was for many years head clerk and confidential
assistant in the family firm at Edinburgh.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, 12th March</i> 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MR. DICK</span>,&mdash;I have been a great while owing
you a letter; but I am not without excuses, as you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
heard. I overworked to get a piece of work finished before
I had my holiday, thinking to enjoy it more; and instead
of that, the machinery near hand came sundry in my
hands! like Murdie&rsquo;s uniform. However, I am now, I
think, in a fair way of recovery; I think I was made,
what there is of me, of whipcord and thorn-switches;
surely I am tough! But I fancy I shall not overdrive
again, or not so long. It is my theory that work is highly
beneficial, but that it should, if possible, and certainly
for such partially broken-down instruments as the thing
I call my body, be taken in batches, with a clear break
and breathing space between. I always do vary my work,
laying one thing aside to take up another, not merely
because I believe it rests the brain, but because I have
found it most beneficial to the result. Reading, Bacon
says, makes a full man, but what makes me full on
any subject is to banish it for a time from all my thoughts.
However, what I now propose is, out of every quarter
to work two months, and rest the third. I believe I shall
get more done, as I generally manage, on my present
scheme, to have four months&rsquo; impotent illness and two
of imperfect health&mdash;one before, one after, I break down.
This, at least, is not an economical division of the year.</p>

<p>I re-read the other day that heartbreaking book, the
<i>Life of Scott</i>. One should read such works now and then,
but O, not often. As I live, I feel more and more that
literature should be cheerful and brave-spirited, even if
it cannot be made beautiful and pious and heroic. We
wish it to be a green place; the Waverley Novels are
better to re-read than the over-true <i>Life</i>, fine as dear Sir
Walter was. The Bible, in most parts, is a cheerful book;
it is our little piping theologies, tracts, and sermons that
are dull and dowie; and even the Shorter Catechism,
which is scarcely a work of consolation, opens with the
best and shortest and completest sermon ever written&mdash;upon
Man&rsquo;s chief end.&mdash;Believe me, my dear Mr. Dick,
very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span></p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You see I have changed my hand. I was threatened
apparently with scrivener&rsquo;s cramp, and at any rate
had got to write so small, that the revisal of my MS. tried
my eyes, hence my signature alone remains upon the old
model; for it appears that if I changed that, I should
be cut off from my &ldquo;vivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="to">To Cosmo Monkhouse</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This amiable and excellent public servant, art-critic, and versifier
was a friend of old Savile Club days; the drift of his letter can
easily be guessed from this reply. The reference to Lamb is to
the essay on the Restoration dramatists.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, March</i> 16, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MONKHOUSE</span>,&mdash;You see with what promptitude
I plunge into correspondence; but the truth is, I am
condemned to a complete inaction, stagnate dismally, and
love a letter. Yours, which would have been welcome at
any time, was thus doubly precious.</p>

<p>Dover sounds somewhat shiveringly in my ears. You
should see the weather <i>I</i> have&mdash;cloudless, clear as crystal,
with just a punkah-draft of the most aromatic air, all
pine and gum tree. You would be ashamed of Dover;
you would scruple to refer, sir, to a spot so paltry. To
be idle at Dover is a strange pretension; pray, how do
you warm yourself? If I were there I should grind knives
or write blank verse, or&mdash;&mdash; But at least you do not
bathe? It is idle to deny it: I have&mdash;I may say I nourish&mdash;a
growing jealousy of the robust, large-legged, healthy
Britain-dwellers, patient of grog, scorners of the timid
umbrella, innocuously breathing fog: all which I once
was, and I am ashamed to say liked it. How ignorant is
youth! grossly rolling among unselected pleasures; and
how nobler, purer, sweeter, and lighter, to sip the choice
tonic, to recline in the luxurious invalid chair, and to
tread, well-shawled, the little round of the constitutional.
Seriously, do you like to repose? Ye gods, I hate it. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
never rest with any acceptation; I do not know what
people mean who say they like sleep and that damned
bedtime which, since long ere I was breeched, has rung
a knell to all my day&rsquo;s doings and beings. And when a
man, seemingly sane, tells me he has &ldquo;fallen in love with
stagnation,&rdquo; I can only say to him, &ldquo;You will never be
a Pirate!&rdquo; This may not cause any regret to Mrs. Monkhouse;
but in your own soul it will clang hollow&mdash;think
of it! Never! After all boyhood&rsquo;s aspirations and
youth&rsquo;s immoral day-dreams, you are condemned to sit
down, grossly draw in your chair to the fat board, and
be a beastly Burgess till you die. Can it be? Is there
not some escape, some furlough from the Moral Law,
some holiday jaunt contrivable into a Better Land?
Shall we never shed blood? This prospect is too grey.</p>

<p>To confess plainly, I had intended to spend my life
(or any leisure I might have from Piracy upon the high
seas) as the leader of a great horde of irregular cavalry,
devastating whole valleys. I can still, looking back, see
myself in many favourite attitudes; signalling for a boat
from my pirate ship with a pocket-handkerchief, I at the
jetty end, and one or two of my bold blades keeping the
crowd at bay; or else turning in the saddle to look back
at my whole command (some five thousand strong) following
me at the hand-gallop up the road out of the burning
valley: this last by moonlight.</p>

<p><i>Et point du tout.</i> I am a poor scribe, and have scarce
broken a commandment to mention, and have recently
dined upon cold veal! As for you (who probably had
some ambitions), I hear of you living at Dover, in lodgings,
like the beasts of the field. But in heaven, when we get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
there, we shall have a good time, and see some real carnage.
For heaven is&mdash;must be&mdash;that great Kingdom of Antinomia,
which Lamb saw dimly adumbrated in the <i>Country
Wife</i>, where the worm which never dies (the conscience)
peacefully expires, and the sinner lies down beside the
Ten Commandments. Till then, here a sheer hulk lies
poor Tom Bowling, with neither health nor vice for anything
more spirited than procrastination, which I may
well call the Consolation Stakes of Wickedness; and by
whose diligent practice, without the least amusement to
ourselves, we can rob the orphan and bring down grey
hairs with sorrow to the dust.</p>

<p>This astonishing gush of nonsense I now hasten to
close, envelope, and expedite to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cliff.
Remember me to Shakespeare, and believe me, yours very

<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Mr. Gosse had written describing the office which he then
occupied, a picturesque old-fashioned chamber in the upper stories
of the Board of Trade.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, March</i> 17, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;Your office&mdash;office is profanely said&mdash;your
bower upon the leads is divine. Have you, like
Pepys, &ldquo;the right to fiddle&rdquo; there? I see you mount
the companion, barbiton in hand, and, fluttered about by
city sparrows, pour forth your spirit in a voluntary. Now
when the spring begins, you must lay in your flowers:
how do you say about a potted hawthorn? Would it
bloom? Wallflower is a choice pot-herb; lily-of-the-valley,
too, and carnation, and Indian cress trailed about
the window, is not only beautiful by colour, but the leaves
are good to eat. I recommend thyme and rosemary for
the aroma, which should not be left upon one side; they
are good quiet growths.</p>

<p>On one of your tables keep a great map spread out; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
chart is still better&mdash;it takes one further&mdash;the havens with
their little anchors, the rocks, banks, and soundings, are
adorably marine; and such furniture will suit your ship-shape
habitation. I wish I could see those cabins; they
smile upon me with the most intimate charm. From
your leads, do you behold St. Paul&rsquo;s? I always like to
see the Foolscap; it is London <i>per se</i> and no spot from
which it is visible is without romance. Then it is good
company for the man of letters, whose veritable nursing
Pater-Noster is so near at hand.</p>

<p>I am all at a standstill; as idle as a painted ship, but
not so pretty. My romance, which has so nearly butchered
me in the writing, not even finished; though so near,
thank God, that a few days of tolerable strength will see
the roof upon that structure. I have worked very hard
at it, and so do not expect any great public favour. <i>In
moments of effort, one learns to do the easy things that people
like.</i> There is the golden maxim; thus one should strain
and then play, strain again and play again. The strain
is for us, it educates; the play is for the reader, and pleases.
Do you not feel so? We are ever threatened by two
contrary faults: both deadly. To sink into what my
forefathers would have called &ldquo;rank conformity,&rdquo; and to
pour forth cheap replicas, upon the one hand; upon the
other, and still more insidiously present, to forget that
art is a diversion and a decoration, that no triumph or
effort is of value, nor anything worth reaching except
charm.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="to">To Miss Ferrier</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>March</i> 22, 1884].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS FERRIER</span>,&mdash;Are you really going to fail
us? This seems a dreadful thing. My poor wife, who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
not well off for friends on this bare coast, has been promising
herself, and I have been promising her, a rare acquisition.
And now Miss Burn has failed, and you utter a
very doubtful note. You do not know how delightful this
place is, nor how anxious we are for a visit. Look at the
names: &ldquo;The Solitude&rdquo;&mdash;is that romantic? The palm-trees?&mdash;how
is that for the gorgeous East? &ldquo;Var&rdquo;?
the name of a river&mdash;&ldquo;the quiet waters by&rdquo;! &rsquo;Tis true,
they are in another department, and consist of stones and
a biennial spate; but what a music, what a plash of brooks,
for the imagination! We have hills; we have skies;
the roses are putting forth, as yet sparsely; the meadows
by the sea are one sheet of jonquils; the birds sing as in
an English May&mdash;for, considering we are in France and
serve up our song-birds, I am ashamed to say, on a little
field of toast and with a sprig of thyme (my own receipt)
in their most innocent and now unvocal bellies&mdash;considering
all this, we have a wonderfully fair wood-music round
this Solitude of ours. What can I say more?&mdash;All this
awaits you. <i>Kennst du das Land</i>, in short.&mdash;Your sincere

<p>Herewith are a set of verses which I thought pretty

good; if not, hand them on to Manhattan, Century, or
Lippincott, at your pleasure, as all three desire my work
or pretend to. But I trust the lines will not go unattended.
Some riverside will haunt you; and O! be

<p class="to">To Thomas Stevenson</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, April</i> 19, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;Yesterday I very powerfully stated
the <i>HÃ¦resis Stevensoniana</i>, or the complete body of divinity
of the family theologian, to Miss Ferrier. She was much
impressed; so was I. You are a great heresiarch; and
I know no better. Whaur the devil did ye get thon about
the soap? Is it altogether your own? I never heard it
elsewhere; and yet I suspect it must have been held at
some time or other, and if you were to look up you would
probably find yourself condemned by some Council.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear you are so well. The hear is excellent.
The Cornhills came; I made Miss Ferrier read us
<i>Thrawn Janet</i>, and was quite bowled over by my own
works. <i>The Merry Men</i> I mean to make much longer,
with a whole new dÃ©nouement, not yet quite clear to me.
<i>The Story of a Lie</i> I must rewrite entirely also, as it is
too weak and ragged, yet is worth saving for the Admiral.
Did I ever tell you that the Admiral was recognised in
America?</p>

<p>When they are all on their legs this will make an excellent
collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span></p>

<p>Has Davie never read <i>Guy Mannering</i>, <i>Rob Roy</i>, or <i>The
Antiquary</i>? All of which are worth three <i>Waverleys</i>.
I think <i>Kenilworth</i> better than <i>Waverley</i>; <i>Nigel</i>, too;
and <i>Quentin Durward</i> about as good. But it shows a
true piece of insight to prefer <i>Waverley</i>, for it <i>is</i> different;
and though not quite coherent, better worked in parts
than almost any other: surely more carefully. It is
undeniable that the love of the slap-dash and the shoddy
grew upon Scott with success. Perhaps it does on many
of us, which may be the granite on which D.&rsquo;s opinion
stands. However, I hold it, in Patrick Walker&rsquo;s phrase,
for an &ldquo;old, condemned, damnable error.&rdquo; Dr. Simson
was condemned by P. W. as being &ldquo;a bagful of&rdquo; such.
One of Patrick&rsquo;s amenities!</p>

<p>Another ground there may be to D.&rsquo;s opinion; those
who avoid (or seek to avoid) Scott&rsquo;s facility are apt to
be continually straining and torturing their style to get
in more of life. And to many the extra significance does
not redeem the strain.</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, April 20th,</i> 1884.</p>

<p>I have been really ill for two days, hemorrhage, weakness,
extreme nervousness that will not let me lie a moment,
and damned sciatica o&rsquo; nights; but to-day I am on the
recovery. Time; for I was miserable. It is not often
that I suffer, with all my turns and tumbles, from the
sense of serious illness; and I hate it, as I believe everybody
does. And then the combination of not being able
to read, not being allowed to speak, being too weak to
write, and not wishing to eat, leaves a man with some
empty seconds. But I bless God, it&rsquo;s over now; to-day
I am much mended.</p>

<p>Insatiable gulf, greedier than hell, and more silent
than the woods of Styx, have you or have you not lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
the dedication to the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>? Answer that
plain question as otherwise I must try to tackle to it
once again.</p>

<p>Sciatica is a word employed much by Shakespeare in
a certain connection. &rsquo;Tis true, he was no physician, but
as I read, he had smarted in his day. I, too, do smart.
And yet this keen soprano agony, these veins of fire and
bombshell explosions in the knee, are as nothing to a
certain dull, drowsy pain I had when my kidneys were
congested at Nice; there was death in that; the creak
of Charon&rsquo;s rowlocks, and the miasmas of the Styx. I
may say plainly, much as I have lost the power of bearing
pain, I had still rather suffer much than die. Not
only the love of life grows on me, but the fear of certain
odd end-seconds grows as well. &rsquo;Tis a suffocating business,
take it how you will; and Tyrrel and Forest only
bunglers.</p>

<p>Well, this is an essay on death, or worse, on dying:
to return to daylight and the winds, I perceive I have
grown to live too much in my work and too little in life.
&rsquo;Tis the dollars do it: the world is too much. Whenever
I think I would like to live a little, I hear the butcher&rsquo;s
cart resounding through the neighbourhood; and so to
plunge again. The fault is a good fault for me; to be
able to do so, is to succeed in life; and my life has been
a huge success. I can live with joy and without disgust
in the art by which I try to support myself; I have the
best wife in the world; I have rather more praise and
nearly as much coin as I deserve; my friends are many
and true-hearted. Sir, it is a big thing in successes.
And if mine anchorage lies something open to the wind,
Sciatica, if the crew are blind, and the captain spits blood,
one cannot have all, and I may be patched up again, who
knows? &ldquo;His timbers yet are (indifferently) sound, and
he may float again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The allusions to Skelt, the last of the designers and etchers of
cheap sheets illustrating the popular dramas and melodramas of
the day, will need no explanation to readers familiar with the
essay <i>A Penny Plain and Twopence Coloured</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res, April 23rd,</i> 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. HADDON</span>,&mdash;I am pleased to see your hand
again, and, waiting my wife&rsquo;s return, to guess at some
of the contents. For various things have befallen me of
late. First, as you see, I had to change my hand; lastly
I have fallen into a kind of blindness, and cannot read.
This more inclines me for something to do, to answer
your letter before I have read it, a safe plan familiar to
diplomatists.</p>

<p>I gather from half shut eyes that you were a Skeltist;
now seriously that is a good beginning; there is a deal
of romance (cheap) in Skelt. Look at it well, and you
will see much of Dickens. And even Skelt is better than
conscientious, grey back-gardens, and conscientious, dull
still lives. The great lack of art just now is a spice of
life and interest; and I prefer galvanism to acquiescence
in the grave. All do not; &rsquo;tis an affair of tastes; and
mine are young. Those who like death have their innings
to-day with art that is like mahogany and horse-hair
furniture, solid, true, serious and as dead as CÃ¦sar. I
wish I could read <i>Treasure Island</i>; I believe I should like
it. But work done, for the artist, is the Golden Goose
killed; you sell its feathers and lament the eggs. To-morrow
the fresh woods!</p>

<p>I have been seriously ill, and do not pick up with that
finality that I should like to see. I linger over and digest
my convalescence like a favourite wine; and what with
blindness, green spectacles, and seclusion, cut but a poor
figure in the world.</p>

<p>I made out at the end that you were asking some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
advice&mdash;but what, my failing eyes refuse to inform me.
I must keep a sheet for the answer; and Mrs. Stevenson
still delays, and still I have no resource against tedium
but the waggling of this pen.</p>

<p>You seem to me to be a pretty lucky young man; keep
your eyes open to your mercies. That part of piety is
eternal; and the man who forgets to be grateful has
fallen asleep in life. Please to recognise that you are
unworthy of all that befalls you&mdash;unworthy, too, I hear
you wail, of this terrible sermon; but indeed we are not
worthy of our fortunes; love takes us in a counterfeit,
success comes to us at play, health stays with us while
we abuse her; and even when we gird at our fellow-men,
we should remember that it is of their good will alone,
that we still live and still have claims to honour. The
sins of the most innocent, if they were exactly visited,
would ruin them to the doer. And if you know any man
who believes himself to be worthy of a wife&rsquo;s love, a friend&rsquo;s
affection, a mistress&rsquo;s caress, even if venal, you may rest
assured he is worthy of nothing but a kicking. I fear
men who have no open faults; what do they conceal?
We are not meant to be good in this world, but to try to
be, and fail, and keep on trying; and when we get a
cake to say, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; and when we get a buffet,
to say, &ldquo;Just so: well hit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been getting some of the buffets of late; but
have amply earned them&mdash;you need not pity me. Pity
sick children and the individual poor man; not the mass.
Don&rsquo;t pity anybody else, and never pity fools. The
optimistic Stevenson; but there is a sense in these wanderings.</p>

<p>Now I have heard your letter, and my sermon was not
mal-Ã -propos. For you seem to be complaining. Everybody&rsquo;s
home is depressing, I believe; it is their difficult
business to make it less so. There is an unpleasant saying,
which would have pricked me sharply at your age.&mdash;Yours
truly,</p>

<p class="to">To Cosmo Monkhouse</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>April</i> 24, 1884].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MONKHOUSE</span>,&mdash;If you are in love with repose,
here is your occasion: change with me. I am too blind
to read, hence no reading; I am too weak to walk, hence
no walking; I am not allowed to speak, hence no talking;
but the great simplification has yet to be named; for, if
this goes on, I shall soon have nothing to eat&mdash;and hence,
O Hallelujah! hence no eating. The offer is a fair one:
I have not sold myself to the devil, for I could never find
him. I am married, but so are you. I sometimes write
verses, but so do you. Come! <i>Hic quies!</i> As for the
commandments, I have broken them so small that they
are the dust of my chambers; you walk upon them,
triturate and toothless; and with the Golosh of Philosophy,
they shall not bite your heel. True, the tenement
is falling. Ay, friend, but yours also. Take a larger
view; what is a year or two? dust in the balance! &rsquo;Tis
done, behold you Cosmo Stevenson, and me R. L. Monkhouse;
you at HyÃ¨res, I in London; you rejoicing in
the clammiest repose, me proceeding to tear your tabernacle
into rags, as I have already so admirably torn my
own.</p>

<p>My place to which I now introduce you&mdash;it is yours&mdash;is
like a London house, high and very narrow; upon the
lungs I will not linger; the heart is large enough for a
ballroom; the belly greedy and inefficient; the brain
stocked with the most damnable explosives, like a dynamiter&rsquo;s
den. The whole place is well furnished, though
not in a very pure taste; Corinthian much of it; showy
and not strong.</p>

<p>About your place I shall try to find my way above,
an interesting exploration. Imagine me, as I go to bed,
falling over a blood-stained remorse; opening that cupboard
in the cerebellum and being welcomed by the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
of your murdered uncle. I should probably not like your
remorses; I wonder if you will like mine; I have a spirited
assortment; they whistle in my ear o&rsquo; nights like a north-easter.
I trust yours don&rsquo;t dine with the family; mine
are better mannered; you will hear nought of them till
2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, except one, to be sure, that I have made a pet of,
but he is small; I keep him in buttons, so as to avoid
commentaries; you will like him much&mdash;if you like what
is genuine.</p>

<p>Must we likewise change religions? Mine is a good
article, with a trick of stopping; cathedral bell note;
ornamental dial; supported by Venus and the Graces;
quite a summer-parlour piety. Of yours, since your last,
I fear there is little to be said.</p>

<p>There is one article I wish to take away with me: my
spirits. They suit me. I don&rsquo;t want yours; I like
my own; I have had them a long while in bottle. It is my
only reservation.&mdash;Yours (as you decide),</p>

<p class="sc rt">R. L. Monkhouse.</p>


<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<p class="rt"><i>La Solitude, HyÃ¨res</i> [<i>May</i> 1884].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR BOY</span>,&mdash;<i>Old Mortality</i><a name="FnAnchor_9" id="FnAnchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> is out, and I am glad to
say Coggie likes it. We like her immensely.</p>

<p>I keep better, but no great shakes yet; cannot work&mdash;cannot:
that is flat, not even verses: as for prose,
that more active place is shut on me long since.</p>

<p>My view of life is essentially the comic; and the
romantically comic. <i>As You Like It</i> is to me the most
bird-haunted spot in letters; <i>Tempest</i> and <i>Twelfth Night</i>
follow. These are what I mean by poetry and nature. I
make an effort of my mind to be quite one with MoliÃ¨re,
except upon the stage, where his inimitable <i>jeux de scÃ¨ne</i>
beggar belief; but you will observe they are stage-plays&mdash;things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
<i>ad hoc</i>; not great Olympian debauches of the
heart and fancy; hence more perfect, and not so great.
Then I come, after great wanderings, to Carmosine and
to Fantasio; to one part of La DerniÃ¨re Aldini (which,
by the by, we might dramatise in a week), to the notes
that Meredith has found, Evan and the postillion, Evan
and Rose, Harry in Germany. And to me these things
are the good; beauty, touched with sex and laughter;
beauty with God&rsquo;s earth for the background. Tragedy
does not seem to me to come off; and when it does, it
does so by the heroic illusion; the anti-masque has been
omitted; laughter, which attends on all our steps in life,
and sits by the deathbed, and certainly redacts the
epitaph, laughter has been lost from these great-hearted
lies. But the comedy which keeps the beauty and touches
the terrors of our life (laughter and tragedy-in-a-good-humour
having kissed), that is the last word of moved
representation; embracing the greatest number of elements
of fate and character; and telling its story, not with the
one eye of pity, but with the two of pity and mirth.</p>

<p>Early in May Stevenson again fell very dangerously ill with
hemorrhage of the lungs, and lay for several weeks between life and
death, until towards the end of June he was brought sufficiently
round to venture by slow stages on the journey to England, staying
for two or three weeks at Royat on the way. His correspondent
had lately been appointed Clark Reader in English Literature at
Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

damned delay; but, I assure you, I was delighted. You
will believe me the more, if I confess to you that my
first sentiment was envy; yes, sir, on my blood-boltered
couch I envied the professor. However, it was not of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
long duration; the double thought that you deserved and
that you would thoroughly enjoy your success fell like
balsam on my wounds. How came it that you never
communicated my rejection of Gilder&rsquo;s offer for the Rhone?
But it matters not. Such earthly vanities are over for the
present. This has been a fine well-conducted illness. A
month in bed; a month of silence; a fortnight of not
stirring my right hand; a month of not moving without
being lifted. Come! <i>Ã‡a y est</i>: devilish like being dead.&mdash;Yours,

the fact would interest you. He was no poetist either;

am back in bed. I am better, and keep better, but the
weather is a mere injustice. The imitation of Edinburgh
is, at times, deceptive; there is a note among the chimney
pots that suggests Howe Street; though I think the
shrillest spot in Christendom was not upon the Howe
Street side, but in front, just under the Miss Graemes&rsquo;
big chimney stack. It had a fine alto character&mdash;a sort
of bleat that used to divide the marrow in my joints&mdash;say
in the wee, slack hours. That music is now lost to us by
rebuilding; another air that I remember, not regret,
was the solo of the gas-burner in the little front room;
a knickering, flighty, fleering, and yet spectral cackle.
I mind it above all on winter afternoons, late, when the
window was blue and spotted with rare rain-drops, and,
looking out, the cold evening was seen blue all over, with
the lamps of Queen&rsquo;s and Frederick&rsquo;s Street dotting it with
yellow, and flaring eastward in the squalls. Heavens, how

<p>I had reported to Stevenson a remark made by one of his greatest
admirers, Sir E. Burne-Jones, on some particular analogy, I forget
what, between a passage of Defoe and one in <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Hotel ChabassiÃ¨re, Royat, July</i> 1884.]</p>

<p>... Here is a quaint thing, I have read <i>Robinson</i>,
<i>Colonel Jack</i>, <i>Moll Flanders</i>, <i>Memoirs of a Cavalier</i>, <i>History
of the Plague</i>, <i>History of the Great Storm</i>, <i>Scotch Church and
Union</i>. And there my knowledge of Defoe ends&mdash;except
a book, the name of which I forget, about Peterborough
in Spain, which Defoe obviously did not write, and could
not have written if he wanted. To which of these does
B. J. refer? I guess it must be the history of the Scottish
Church. I jest; for, of course, I <i>know</i> it must be a book
I have never read, and which this makes me keen to read&mdash;I
mean <i>Captain Singleton</i>. Can it be got and sent to
me? If <i>Treasure Island</i> is at all like it, it will be delightful.
I was just the other day wondering at my folly in
not remembering it, when I was writing <i>T. I.</i>, as a mine
for pirate tips. <i>T. I.</i> came out of Kingsley&rsquo;s <i>At Last</i>,
where I got the Dead Man&rsquo;s Chest&mdash;and that was the seed&mdash;and
out of the great Captain Johnson&rsquo;s <i>History of
Notorious Pirates</i>. The scenery is Californian in part, and
in part <i>chic</i>.</p>

patience, or to see my wife play it, is become the be-all
and the end-all of my dim career. To add to my gaiety,
I may write letters, but there are few to answer. Patience
and Poesy are thus my rod and staff; with these I not
unpleasantly support my days.</p>

<p>I am very dim, dumb, dowie, and damnable. I hate
to be silenced; and if to talk by signs is my forte (as I
contend), to understand them cannot be my wife&rsquo;s. Do
not think me unhappy; I have not been so for years;
but I am blurred, inhabit the debatable frontier of sleep,
and have but dim designs upon activity. All is at a standstill;
books closed, paper put aside, the voice, the eternal
voice of R. L. S., well silenced. Hence this plaint reaches

<h3>VIII</h3>

<h3>LIFE AT BOURNEMOUTH</h3>

<h5><span class="sc">September</span> 1884&mdash;<span class="sc">August</span> 1887</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Arriving</span> in England at the end of July 1884, Stevenson
took up his quarters first for a few weeks at Richmond.
He was compelled to abandon the hope of making his
permanent home at HyÃ¨res, partly by the renewed failure
there of his own health, partly by a bad outbreak of cholera
which occurred in the old ProvenÃ§al town about the time
he left it. After consultation with several doctors, all of
whom held out hopes of ultimate recovery despite the
gravity of his present symptoms, he moved to Bournemouth.
Here he found in the heaths and pinewoods some
distant semblance of the landscape of his native Scotland,
and in the sandy curves of the Channel coast a passable
substitute for the bays and promontories of his beloved
Mediterranean. At all events, he liked the place well
enough to be willing to try it for a home; and such it
became for all but three years, from September 1884 to
August 1887. These, although in the matter of health
the worst and most trying years of his life, were in the
matter of work some of the most active and successful.
For the first two or three months the Stevensons occupied
a lodging on the West Cliff called Wensleydale; for the
next five, from mid-November 1884 to mid-April 1885,
they were tenants of a house named Bonallie Towers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
pleasantly situated amid the pinewoods of Branksome
Park, and by its name recalling familiar Midlothian associations.
Lastly, about Easter 1885, they entered into
occupation of a house of their own, given by the elder
Mr. Stevenson as a special gift to his daughter-in-law,
and renamed by its new occupants Skerryvore, in reminiscence
of one of the great lighthouse works carried out by
the family firm off the Scottish coast.</p>

<p>During all the time of Stevenson&rsquo;s residence at Bournemouth
he was compelled to lead the life, irksome to him
above all men, but borne with invincible spirit and patience,
of a chronic invalid and almost constant prisoner to the
house. A great part of his time had perforce to be spent
in bed, and there almost all his literary work was produced.
Often for days, and sometimes for whole weeks together,
he was forbidden to speak aloud, and compelled to carry
on conversation with his family and friends in whispers
or with the help of pencil and paper. The few excursions
to a distance which he attempted&mdash;most commonly to
my house at the British Museum, once to Cambridge,
once to Matlock, once to Exeter, and once in 1886 as
far as Paris&mdash;these excursions generally ended in a breakdown
and a hurried retreat to home and bed. Nevertheless,
he was able in intervals of comparative ease to
receive and enjoy the visits of friends from a distance
both old and new&mdash;among the most welcome of the latter
being Mr. Henry James, Mr. William Archer, and Mr.
John S. Sargent; while among Bournemouth residents
who attached themselves to him on terms of special intimacy
and affection were Sir Percy and Lady Shelley and Sir
Henry and Lady Taylor and their daughters.</p>

<p>At the same time, seizing and making the most of
every week, nay, every day and hour of respite, he contrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
to produce work surprising, under the circumstances,
alike by quantity and quality. During the first
two months of his life at Bournemouth the two plays
<i>Admiral Guinea</i> and <i>Beau Austin</i> were written in collaboration
with Mr. Henley, and many other dramatic schemes
were broached which health and leisure failed him to carry
out. In the course of the next few months he finished
<i>Prince Otto</i>, <i>The Child&rsquo;s Garden of Verses</i>, and <i>More New
Arabian Nights</i>, all three of which had been begun, and
the two first almost completed, before he left HyÃ¨res.
He at the same time attacked two new tasks&mdash;a highway
novel called <i>The Great North Road</i>, and a <i>Life of Wellington</i>
for a series edited by Mr. Andrew Lang, both of which
he had in the sequel to abandon; and a third, the boys&rsquo;
story of <i>Kidnapped</i>, which in its turn had to be suspended,
but on its publication next year turned out one of the
most brilliant of his successes.</p>

<p>About midsummer of this year, 1885, he was distressed
by the sudden death of his old and kind friend
Professor Fleeming Jenkin, and after a while undertook
the task of writing a memoir of him to be prefixed to
his collected papers. Towards the close of the same year
he was busy with what proved to be the most popular
of all his writings, <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde</i>, and with the Christmas story of <i>Olalla</i>. <i>Jekyll
and Hyde</i> was published in January 1886, and after threatening
for the first week or two to fall flat, in no long time
caught the attention of all classes of readers, was quoted
from a hundred pulpits, and made the writer&rsquo;s name
familiar to multitudes both in England and America whom
it had never reached before. A success scarcely inferior,
though of another kind, was made a few months afterwards
by <i>Kidnapped</i>, which Stevenson had taken up again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
in the early spring, and which was published about midsummer.
After completing this task in March, he was
able to do little work during the remainder of the year,
except in preparing materials for the <i>Life of Fleeming
Jenkin</i>, and in writing occasional verses which helped to
make up the collection published in the following year
under the title <i>Underwoods</i>. In the early autumn of the
same year, 1886, he took a longer and more successful
excursion from home than usual, staying without breakdown
for two or three weeks at the Monument, as he
always called my house at the British Museum, and seeing
something of kindred spirits among his elders, such as
Robert Browning, James Russell Lowell, the painters
Burne-Jones and W. B. Richmond, and others who had
hitherto delighted in his work and now learned to delight
no less in his society.</p>

<p>Thence he went with Mr. Henley for a short trip to
Paris, chiefly in order to see the sculptor Rodin and his
old friends Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Low. From this trip he
returned none the worse, but during all the later autumn
and winter at Bournemouth was again hampered in his
work by renewed and prolonged attacks of illness. A
further cause of trouble was the distressing failure of
his father&rsquo;s health and spirits, attended by symptoms
which plainly indicated the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>For some weeks of April, 1887, he was much taken up
with a scheme which had nothing to do with literature,
and which the few friends to whom he confided it regarded
as wildly Quixotic and unwise. In these years he had,
as we have seen, taken deeply to heart both what he
thought the guilty remissness of Government action in
the matter of the Soudan garrisons and of Gordon, and
the tameness of acquiescence with which the national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
conscience appeared to take the result. He had been
not less disturbed at the failure, hitherto, of successive
administrations to assert the reign of law in Ireland.
He was no blind partisan of the English cause in that
country, and had even written of the hereditary hatred
of Irish for English as a sentiment justified by the facts
of history. But he held strongly that private warfare,
the use of dynamite and the knife, with the whole system
of agrarian vengeances and the persecution of the weak,
were means which no end could justify; and that redress
of grievances, whatever form it might ultimately take,
must be preceded by the re-establishment of law. In
<i>More New Arabian Nights</i>, published the year before,
he had endeavoured &ldquo;to make dynamite ridiculous if he
could not make it horrible,&rdquo; and to the old elements of
fantastic invention, and humorously solemn realism in
the unreal, had added the new element of a witty and
scornful criminal psychology. A case that now appealed
to him with especial force was that of the cruel persecution
kept up against the widow and daughters of the
murdered man Curtin. He determined that if no one
else would take up the duty of resisting such persecution
without regard to consequences, he would take it up himself,
in the hope of more effectually rousing the public
conscience to the evils of the time. His plan was to go
with his family, occupy and live upon the derelict farm,
and let happen what would. This, as the letters referring
to the matter plainly show, was no irresponsible dream
or whim, but a purpose conceived in absolute and sober
earnest. His wife and household were prepared to follow,
though under protest, had he persisted; as it seemed
for some weeks that he certainly would, until at last the
arguments of his friends, and still more the unmistakable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
evidence that his father&rsquo;s end was near, persuaded him
to give up his purpose. But to the last, I think he was
never well satisfied that in giving way he had not been a
coward, preferring fireside ease and comfort to the call of
a public duty.</p>

<p>After spending a part of the winter at Bournemouth
and a part at Torquay, both Stevenson&rsquo;s parents returned
to Edinburgh in April 1887; and within a few weeks
after their arrival he was summoned north to his father&rsquo;s
death-bed. He stayed at Edinburgh the short time
necessary for the dispatch of business, and returned to his
own sick-room life at Skerryvore.</p>

<p>During the two years and nine months of Stevenson&rsquo;s
residence at Bournemouth, preceding the date of his
father&rsquo;s death, he had made no apparent progress towards
recovery. Every period of respite had been quickly
followed by a relapse, and all his work, brilliant and varied
as it was, had been done under conditions which would
have reduced almost any other man to inactivity. The
close and frequently recurring struggles against the danger
of death from hemorrhage and exhaustion, which he had
been used, when they first occurred, to find exciting, grew
in the long run merely irksome; and even his persistent
high courage and gaiety, sustained as they were by the
devoted affection of his wife and many friends, began
occasionally, for the first time, to fail him. Accordingly,
when in May 1887 the death of his father severed the
strongest of the ties which bound him to the old country,
he was very ready to listen to the advice of his physicians,
who were unanimous in thinking his case not hopeless,
but urged him to try some complete change of climate,
surroundings, and mode of life. His wife&rsquo;s connections
pointing to the West, he thought of the mountain health-resorts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
of Colorado, and of their growing reputation for
the cure of lung patients. Having let his house at Bournemouth,
he accordingly took passage on board the <span class="sc">S.S.</span>
<i>Ludgate Hill</i>, sailing for New York from London on August
21st, 1887, with his whole party, consisting of his wife,
his widowed mother, whom they had persuaded to join
them, his young stepson, and a trusted servant, Valentine
Roch. The concluding letters of the present section tell
of the preparations for this departure.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Wensleydale, Bournemouth, October</i> 1884?]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR BOY</span>,&mdash;I trust this finds you well; it leaves me
so-so. The weather is so cold that I must stick to bed,
which is rotten and tedious, but can&rsquo;t be helped.</p>

<p>I find in the blotting book the enclosed, which I wrote
to you the eve of my blood. Is it not strange? That
night, when I naturally thought I was coopered, the
thought of it was much in my mind; I thought it had
gone; and I thought what a strange prophecy I had made
in jest, and how it was indeed like to be the end of many
letters. But I have written a good few since, and the
spell is broken. I am just as pleased, for I earnestly desire
to live. This pleasant middle age into whose port we are
steering is quite to my fancy. I would cast anchor here,
and go ashore for twenty years and see the manners of
the place. Youth was a great time, but somewhat fussy.
Now in middle age (bar lucre) all seems mighty placid. It
likes me; I spy a little bright cafÃ© in one corner of the
port, in front of which I now propose we should sit down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
There is just enough of the bustle of the harbour and
no more; and the ships are close in, regarding us with
stern-windows&mdash;the ships that bring deals from Norway
and parrots from the Indies. Let us sit down here for
twenty years, with a packet of tobacco and a drink, and
talk of art and women. By-and-by, the whole city will
sink, and the ships too, and the table, and we also; but
we shall have sat for twenty years and had a fine talk;
and by that time, who knows? exhausted the subject.</p>

<p>I send you a book which (or I am mistook) will please
you; it pleased me. But I do desire a book of adventure&mdash;a
romance&mdash;and no man will get or write me one. Dumas
I have read and re-read too often; Scott, too and I am
short. I want to hear swords clash. I want a book to
begin in a good way; a book, I guess, like <i>Treasure Island</i>,
alas! which I have never read, and cannot though I
live to ninety. I would God that some one else had
written it! By all that I can learn, it is the very book
for my complaint. I like the way I hear it opens; and
they tell me John Silver is good fun. And to me it is,
and must ever be, a dream unrealised, a book unwritten.
O my sighings after romance, or even Skeltery, and O!
the weary age which will produce me neither!</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In reply to a gift of books, including the correspondent&rsquo;s well-known
translation of Sophocles.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Wensleydale, Bournemouth, November</i> 1884.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CAMPBELL</span>,&mdash;The books came duly to hand.
My wife has occupied the translation ever since, nor have
I yet been able to dislodge her. As for the primer, I have
read it with a very strange result: that I find no fault.
If you knew how, dogmatic and pugnacious, I stand
warden on the literary art, you would the more appreciate
your success and my&mdash;well, I will own it&mdash;disappointment.
For I love to put people right (or wrong) about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
the arts. But what you say of Tragedy and of Sophocles
very amply satisfies me; it is well felt and well said; a
little less technically than it is my weakness to desire to
see it put, but clear and adequate. You are very right
to express your admiration for the resource displayed
in &OElig;dipus King; it is a miracle. Would it not have been
well to mention Voltaire&rsquo;s interesting onslaught, a thing
which gives the best lesson of the difference of neighbour
arts?&mdash;since all his criticisms, which had been fatal to a
narrative, do not amount among them to exhibit one
flaw in this masterpiece of drama. For the drama, it is
perfect; though such a fable in a romance might make
the reader crack his sides, so imperfect, so ethereally slight
is the verisimilitude required of these conventional, rigid,
and egg-dancing arts.</p>

<p>I was sorry to see no more of you; but shall conclude
by hoping for better luck next time. My wife begs to be
remembered to both of you.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

advice more specific than a copybook. Give him my
love, however, and tell him it is the mark of the parochial

a foreign land. Let him hold on, and he will find one
country as good as another; and in the meanwhile let
him resist the fatal British tendency to communicate his
dissatisfaction with a country to its inhabitants. &rsquo;Tis a
good idea, but it somehow fails to please. In a fortnight,
if I can keep my spirit in the box at all, I should be nearly
through this Arabian desert; so can tackle something
fresh.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="to">To W. H. Low</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>It was some twenty months since the plan of publishing the
<i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i> in the first instance as a picture-book had been
mooted (see above, pp. 18, foll.). But it had never taken effect, and
in the following March the volume appeared without illustrations
in England, and also, I believe, in America.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Branksome Park, Bournemouth,<br />
Hants, England, First week in November, I guess,</i> 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;Now, look here, the above is my
address for three months, I hope; continue, on your part,
if you please, to write to Edinburgh, which is safe; but
if Mrs. Low thinks of coming to England, she might take
a run down from London (four hours from Waterloo,
main line) and stay a day or two with us among the pines.
If not, I hope it will be only a pleasure deferred till you
can join her.</p>

<p>My Children&rsquo;s Verses will be published here in a volume
called <i>A Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>. The sheets are in hand; I will
see if I cannot send you the lot, so that you might have
a bit of a start. In that case I would do nothing to publish
in the States, and you might try an illustrated edition
there; which, if the book went fairly over here, might,
when ready, be imported. But of this more fully ere
long. You will see some verses of mine in the last Magazine
of Art, with pictures by a young lady; rather pretty, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
think. If we find a market for <i>Phasellulus loquitur</i>, we
can try another. I hope it isn&rsquo;t necessary to put the verse
into that rustic printing. I am Philistine enough to prefer
clean printer&rsquo;s type; indeed, I can form no idea of the
verses thus transcribed by the incult and tottering hand
of the draughtsman, nor gather any impression beyond
one of weariness to the eyes. Yet the other day, in the
Century, I saw it imputed as a crime to Vedder that he
had not thus travestied Omar KhayyÃ m. We live in a
rum age of music without airs, stories without incident,
pictures without beauty, American wood engravings that
should have been etchings, and dry-point etchings that
ought to have been mezzotints. I think of giving &rsquo;em
literature without words; and I believe if you were to try
invisible illustration, it would enjoy a considerable vogue.
So long as an artist is on his head, is painting with a flute,
or writes with an etcher&rsquo;s needle, or conducts the orchestra
with a meat-axe, all is well; and plaudits shower along
with roses. But any plain man who tries to follow the
obtrusive canons of his art, is but a commonplace figure.
To hell with him is the motto, or at least not that; for
he will have his reward, but he will never be thought a
person of parts.</p>

<p><i>January 3, 1885.</i>&mdash;And here has this been lying near
two months. I have failed to get together a preliminary
copy of the Child&rsquo;s Verses for you, in spite of doughty
efforts; but yesterday I sent you the first sheet of the
definitive edition, and shall continue to send the others
as they come. If you can, and care to, work them&mdash;why
so, well. If not, I send you fodder. But the time presses;
for though I will delay a little over the proofs, and though
it is even possible they may delay the English issue until
Easter, it will certainly not be later. Therefore perpend,
and do not get caught out. Of course, if you can do
pictures, it will be a great pleasure to me to see our names
joined; and more than that, a great advantage, as I
dare say you may be able to make a bargain for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
share a little less spectral than the common for the poor

to hear your boy is better: ah, that&rsquo;s where it bites, I
know, that is where the childless man rejoices; although,
to confess fully, my whole philosophy of life renounces
these renunciations; I am persuaded we gain nothing in
the least comparable to what we lose, by holding back
the hand from any province of life; the intrigue, the
imbroglio, such as it is, was made for the plunger and
not for the teetotaller. And anyway I hope your news

<p>I have nearly finished Lawson&rsquo;s most lively pamphlet.
It is very clear and interesting. For myself, I am in our

us and find me in a repaired and more comfortable condition&mdash;greatly

New Arabians for the pot.</p>

<p>I wonder what you do without regular habits of work.
I am capable of only two theories of existence: the industrious
worker&rsquo;s, the spreester&rsquo;s; all between seems blank
to me. We grow too old, and I, at least, am too much
deteriorated, for the last; and the first becomes a bedrock
necessary. My father is in a gloomy state and has
the yellow flag at the peak, or the fore, or wherever it
should be; and he has just emptied some melancholy
vials on me; I am also, by way of change, spitting blood.
This somewhat clouds the termination of my note.&mdash;Yours

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;Allow me to say, in a strictly Pickwickian
sense, that you are a silly fellow. I am pained
indeed, but how should I be offended? I think you
exaggerate; I cannot forget that you had the same
impression of the <i>Deacon</i>; and yet, when you saw it
played, were less revolted than you looked for; and I
will still hope that the <i>Admiral</i> also is not so bad as you
suppose. There is one point, however, where I differ
from you very frankly. Religion is in the world; I do
not think you are the man to deny the importance of its
rÃ´le; and I have long decided not to leave it on one side
in art. The opposition of the Admiral and Mr. Pew is
not, to my eyes, either horrible or irreverent; but it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
be, and it probably is, very ill done: what then? This is
a failure; better luck next time; more power to the
elbow, more discretion, more wisdom in the design, and
the old defeat becomes the scene of the new victory.
Concern yourself about no failure; they do not cost lives

<p><span class="scs">DEAR BOY</span>,&mdash;I have been nearly smashed altogether;
fever and chills, with really very considerable suffering;
and to my deep gloom and some fear about the future,
work has had to stop. There was no way out of it; yesterday
and to-day nothing would come, it was a mere waste
of tissue, productive of spoiled paper.</p>

<p>I hope it will not last long; for the bum-baily is panting
at my rump, and when I turn a scared eye across my
shoulder, I behold his talons quivering above my frock-coat
tails.</p>

<p>Gosse has writ to offer me Â£40 for a Christmas number
ghost story for the Pall Mall: eight thousand words. I
have, with some conditions, accepted; I pray Heaven I may
be able to do it. But I am not sure that my incapacity
to work is wholly due to illness; I believe the morphine

I have been taking for my bray may have a hand in it.
It moderates the bray, but, I think, sews up the donkey.</p>

<p>I think my wife is a little better. If only I could get
in trim, and get this work done, I should be quite chipper.</p>

proudly styled, as you perceive; but the deevil a tower

We are all vilely unwell. I put in the dark watches

by aches and shivers. There is thus little monotony

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, Nov.</i> 13, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BOY</span>,&mdash;A thousand thanks for the <i>MoliÃ¨re</i>. I
have already read, in this noble presentment, <i>La Comtesse
d&rsquo;Escarbaguas</i>, <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i>, and a part of <i>Les
Femmes Savantes</i>; I say, Poquelin took damned good
care of himself: Argan and Arysule, what parts! Many
thanks also for John Silver&rsquo;s pistol; I recognise it; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
was the one he gave Jim Hawkins at the mouth
of the pit; I shall get a plate put upon it to that
effect.</p>

<p>My birthday was a great success; I was better in
health; I got delightful presents; I received the definite
commission from the P.M.G., and began to write the tale;
and in the evening Bob arrived, a simple seraph. We
have known each other ten years; and here we are, too,
like the pair that met in the infirmary: why can we not
mellow into kindness and sweetness like Bob? What is
the reason? Does nature, even in my octogenarian carcase,
run too strong that I must be still a bawler and a
brawler and a treader upon corns? You, at least, have
achieved the miracle of embellishing your personal appearance
to that point that, unless your mother is a woman
of even more perspicacity than I suppose, it is morally
impossible that she can recognise you. When I saw you
ten years ago, you looked rough and&mdash;kind of stigmatised,
a look of an embittered political shoemaker; where is it
now? You now come waltzing around like some light-hearted
monarch; essentially jovial, essentially royal;
radiant of smiles. And in the meanwhile, by a complementary
process, I turn into a kind of hunchback
with white hair! The devil.</p>

<p>Well, let us be thankful for our mercies; in these ten
years what a change from the cell in the hospital, and
the two sick boys in the next bed, to the influence, the
recognition, the liberty, and the happiness of to-day!
Well, well; fortune is not so blind as people say; you
dreed a good long weird; but you have got into a fine
green paddock now to kick your heels in. And I, too,
what a difference; what a difference in my work, in my
situation, and unfortunately, also in my health! But one
need not complain of a pebble in the shoe, when by mere
justice one should rot in a dungeon.</p>

<p>Many thanks to both of you; long life to our friendship,
and that means, I do most firmly believe, to these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
clay continents on which we fly our colours; good luck

he could a tale drafted in the Pitlochry days, <i>The Body Snatcher</i>,
which was advertised in the streets of London by sandwich-men
carrying posters so horrific that they were suppressed, if I remember

<p><span class="scs">DEAR DOBSON</span>,&mdash;Set down my delay to your own fault;
I wished to acknowledge such a gift from you in some
of my inapt and slovenly rhymes; but you should have
sent me your pen and not your desk. The verses stand
up to the axles in a miry cross-road, whence the coursers
of the sun shall never draw them; hence I am constrained
to this uncourtliness, that I must appear before one of
the kings of that country of rhyme without my singing
robes. For less than this, if we may trust the book of
Esther, favourites have tasted death; but I conceive the
kingdom of the Muses mildlier mannered; and in particular
that county which you administer and which I seem to
see as a half-suburban land; a land of hollyhocks and
country houses; a land where at night, in thorny and
sequestered bypaths, you will meet masqueraders going
to a ball in their sedans, and the rector steering homeward
by the light of his lantern; a land of the windmill,
and the west wind, and the flowering hawthorn with a
little scented letter in the hollow of its trunk, and the
kites flying over all in the season of kites, and the far
away blue spires of a cathedral city.</p>

<p>Will you forgive me, then, for my delay and accept
my thanks not only for your present, but for the letter
which followed it, and which perhaps I more particularly
value, and believe me to be, with much admiration, yours

<p>The following to Mr. Henry James refers to the essay of R. L. S.
called <i>A Humble Remonstrance</i>, which had just appeared in Longman&rsquo;s
Magazine. Mr. James had written holding out the prospect
of a continuance of the friendly controversy which had thus been
opened up between them on the aims and qualities of fiction.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Branksome Park,
Bournemouth, December</i> 8, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENRY JAMES</span>,&mdash;This is a very brave hearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
from more points than one. The first point is that there
is a hope of a sequel. For this I laboured. Seriously,
from the dearth of information and thoughtful interest
in the art of literature, those who try to practise it with
any deliberate purpose run the risk of finding no fit
audience. People suppose it is &ldquo;the stuff&rdquo; that interests
them; they think, for instance, that the prodigious fine
thoughts and sentiments in Shakespeare impress by their
own weight, not understanding that the unpolished diamond
is but a stone. They think that striking situations, or
good dialogue, are got by studying life; they will not
rise to understand that they are prepared by deliberate
artifice and set off by painful suppressions. Now, I want
the whole thing well ventilated, for my own education
and the public&rsquo;s; and I beg you to look as quick as you
can, to follow me up with every circumstance of defeat
where we differ, and (to prevent the flouting of the laity)
to emphasise the points where we agree. I trust your
paper will show me the way to a rejoinder; and that
rejoinder I shall hope to make with so much art as to woo
or drive you from your threatened silence. I would not
ask better than to pass my life in beating out this quarter
of corn with such a seconder as yourself.</p>

<p>Point the second&mdash;I am rejoiced indeed to hear you
speak so kindly of my work; rejoiced and surprised. I
seem to myself a very rude, left-handed countryman; not
fit to be read, far less complimented, by a man so accomplished,
so adroit, so craftsmanlike as you. You will
happily never have cause to understand the despair with
which a writer like myself considers (say) the park scene
in <i>Lady Barberina</i>. Every touch surprises me by its
intangible precision; and the effect when done, as light
as syllabub, as distinct as a picture, fills me with envy.
Each man among us prefers his own aim, and I prefer
mine; but when we come to speak of performance, I recognise
myself, compared with you, to be a lout and slouch
of the first water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span></p>

<p>Where we differ, both as to the design of stories and
the delineation of character, I begin to lament. Of course,
I am not so dull as to ask you to desert your walk; but
could you not, in one novel, to oblige a sincere admirer,
and to enrich his shelves with a beloved volume, could
you not, and might you not, cast your characters in a
mould a little more abstract and academic (dear Mrs.
Pennyman had already, among your other work, a taste
of what I mean), and pitch the incidents, I do not say
in any stronger, but in a slightly more emphatic key&mdash;as
it were an episode from one of the old (so-called) novels
of adventure? I fear you will not; and I suppose I must
sighingly admit you to be right. And yet, when I see, as
it were, a book of Tom Jones handled with your exquisite
precision and shot through with those side-lights of reflection
in which you excel, I relinquish the dear vision with
regret. Think upon it.</p>

<p>As you know, I belong to that besotted class of man,
the invalid: this puts me to a stand in the way of visits.
But it is possible that some day you may feel that a day
near the sea and among pinewoods would be a pleasant
change from town. If so, please let us know; and my
wife and I will be delighted to put you up, and give you
what we can to eat and drink (I have a fair bottle of claret).&mdash;On
the back of which, believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I reopen this to say that I have re-read my
paper, and cannot think I have at all succeeded in being
either veracious or polite. I knew, of course, that I took
your paper merely as a pin to hang my own remarks
upon; but, alas! what a thing is any paper! What fine
remarks can you not hang on mine! How I have sinned

O man, look at the Beam in our own Eyes; and whatever

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;Here was I in bed; not writing, not
hearing, and finding myself gently and agreeably ill used;
and behold I learn you are bad yourself. Get your wife
to send us a word how you are. I am better decidedly.
Bogue got his Christmas card, and behaved well for three
days after. It may interest the cynical to learn that I
started my last hemorrhage by too sedulous attentions to
my dear Bogue. The stick was broken; and that night
Bogue, who was attracted by the extraordinary aching of
his bones, and is always inclined to a serious view of his
own ailments, announced with his customary pomp that
he was dying. In this case, however, it was not the dog
that died. (He had tried to bite his mother&rsquo;s ankles.) I
have written a long and peculiarly solemn paper on the
technical elements of style. It is path-breaking and
epoch-making; but I do not think the public will be readily
convoked to its perusal. Did I tell you that S. C. had
risen to the paper on James? At last! O but I was
pleased; he&rsquo;s (like Johnnie) been lang, lang o&rsquo; comin&rsquo;,
but here he is. He will not object to my future man&oelig;uvres
in the same field, as he has to my former. All the family
are here; my father better than I have seen him these
two years; my mother the same as ever. I do trust you
are better, and I am yours ever,</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;I am so accustomed to hear nonsense
spoken about all the arts, and the drama in particular,
that I cannot refrain from saying &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for your
paper. In my answer to Mr. James, in the December
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
Longman, you may see that I have merely touched, I
think in a parenthesis, on the drama; but I believe
enough was said to indicate our agreement in
essentials.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR S. C.</span>,&mdash;I am on my feet again, and getting on
my boots to do the Iron Duke. Conceive my glee: I have
refused the Â£100, and am to get some sort of royalty, not
yet decided, instead. &rsquo;Tis for Longman&rsquo;s <i>English Worthies</i>,
edited by A. Lang. Aw haw, haw!</p>

<p>Now, look here, could you get me a loan of the
Despatches, or is that a dream? I should have to mark
passages I fear, and certainly note pages on the fly. If
you think it a dream, will Bain get me a second-hand
copy, or who would? The sooner, and cheaper, I can
get it the better. If there is anything in your weird
library that bears on either the man or the period, put it
in a mortar and fire it here instanter; I shall catch. I
shall want, of course, an infinity of books: among which,
any lives there may be; a life of the Marquis Marmont
(the MarÃ©chal), <i>Marmont&rsquo;s Memoirs</i>, <i>Greville&rsquo;s Memoirs</i>,
<i>Peel&rsquo;s Memoirs</i>, <i>Napier</i>, that blind man&rsquo;s history of England
you once lent me, Hamley&rsquo;s <i>Waterloo</i>; can you get me
any of these? Thiers, idle Thiers also. Can you help a
man getting into his boots for such a huge campaign?

have a good one, but on whose funds I cannot fancy:

<p>Stevenson had been asked by his father to look over the proofs

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, 14th January</i> 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;I am glad you like the changes.
I own I was pleased with my hand&rsquo;s darg; you may
observe, I have corrected several errors which (you may
tell Mr. Dick) he had allowed to pass his eagle eye; I
wish there may be none in mine; at least, the order is
better. The second title, &ldquo;Some New Engineering Questions
involved in the M. S. C. Scheme of last Session of
P.,&rdquo; likes me the best. I think it a very good paper;
and I am vain enough to think I have materially helped
to polish the diamond. I ended by feeling quite proud
of the paper, as if it had been mine; the next time you
have as good a one, I will overhaul it for the wages of
feeling as clever as I did when I had managed to understand
and helped to set it clear. I wonder if I anywhere
misapprehended you? I rather think not at the last; at
the first shot I know I missed a point or two. Some of
what may appear to you to be wanton changes, a little
study will show to be necessary.</p>

<p>Yes, Carlyle was ashamed of himself as few men have
been; and let all carpers look at what he did. He prepared
all these papers for publication with his own hand;
all his wife&rsquo;s complaints, all the evidence of his own misconduct:
who else would have done so much? Is repentance,
which God accepts, to have no avail with men?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
nor even with the dead? I have heard too much against
the thrawn, discomfortable dog: dead he is, and we may
be glad of it; but he was a better man than most of us,
no less patently than he was a worse. To fill the world
with whining is against all my views: I do not like impiety.
But&mdash;but&mdash;there are two sides to all things, and the old
scalded baby had his noble side.&mdash;Ever affectionate son,</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, January</i> 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR S. C.</span>,&mdash;I have addressed a letter to the G. O. M.
<i>Ã  propos</i> of Wellington; and I became aware, you will
be interested to hear, of an overwhelming respect for the
old gentleman. I can <i>blaguer</i> his failures; but when you
actually address him, and bring the two statures and
records to confrontation, dismay is the result. By mere
continuance of years, he must impose; the man who
helped to rule England before I was conceived, strikes
me with a new sense of greatness and antiquity, when I
must actually beard him with the cold forms of correspondence.
I shied at the necessity of calling him plain
&ldquo;Sir&rdquo;! Had he been &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; I had been happier;
no, I am no equalitarian. Honour to whom honour is
due; and if to none, why, then, honour to the old!</p>

<p>These, O Slade Professor, are my unvarnished sentiments:
I was a little surprised to find them so extreme,
and therefore I communicate the fact.</p>

<p>Belabour thy brains, as to whom it would be well to
question. I have a small space; I wish to make a popular
book, nowhere obscure, nowhere, if it can be helped,
unhuman. It seems to me the most hopeful plan to tell
the tale, so far as may be, by anecdote. He did not die
till so recently, there must be hundreds who remember
him, and thousands who have still ungarnered stories.
Dear man, to the breach! Up, soldier of the iron dook,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
up, Slades, and at &rsquo;em! (which, conclusively, he did not
say: the at &rsquo;em-ic theory is to be dismissed). You know
piles of fellows who must reek with matter; help! help!
I am going to try Happy-and-Glorious-long-to-reign-over-us.
H.M. must remember things: and it is my belief, if
my letter could be discreetly introduced, she would like
to tell them. So I jest, when I don&rsquo;t address my mind
to it: when I do, shall I be smit louting to my knee, as
before the G. O. M.? ProblÃ¨me!&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In the two following letters are expressed some of the distress
and bitterness with which, in common with most Englishmen,
Stevenson felt the circumstances of Gordon&rsquo;s abandonment in the
Soudan and the failure of the belated attempt to rescue him. The
advice to go on with &ldquo;my book&rdquo; refers, if I remember right, to
some scheme for the republication in book form of stray magazine
papers of mine of a more or less personal or biographical nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, February</i> 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;You are indeed a backward correspondent,
and much may be said against you. But in
this weather, and O dear! in this political scene of degradation,
much must be forgiven. I fear England is dead
of Burgessry, and only walks about galvanised. I do not
love to think of my countrymen these days; nor to
remember myself. Why was I silent? I feel I have no
right to blame any one; but I won&rsquo;t write to the G. O. M.
I do really not see my way to any form of signature, unless
&ldquo;your fellow criminal in the eyes of God,&rdquo; which might
disquiet the proprieties.</p>

<p>About your book, I have always said: go on. The
drawing of character is a different thing from publishing
the details of a private career. No one objects to the first,
or should object, if his name be not put upon it; at
the other, I draw the line. In a preface, if you chose,
you might distinguish; it is, besides, a thing for which you
are eminently well equipped, and which you would do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
with taste and incision. I long to see the book. People
like themselves (to explain a little more); no one likes
his life, which is a misbegotten issue, and a tale of failure.
To see these failures either touched upon, or <i>coasted</i>, to
get the idea of a spying eye and blabbing tongue about
the house, is to lose all privacy in life. To see that thing,
which we do love, our character, set forth, is ever gratifying.
See how my <i>Talk and Talkers</i> went; every one
liked his own portrait, and shrieked about other people&rsquo;s;
so it will be with yours. If you are the least true to the
essential, the sitter will be pleased; very likely not his
friends, and that from <i>various motives</i>.</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt1">When will your holiday be? I sent your letter to my

<p class="to">To J. A. Symonds</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, February</i> 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SYMONDS</span>,&mdash;Yes we have both been very
neglectful. I had horrid luck, catching two thundering
influenzas in August and November. I recovered from
the last with difficulty, but have come through this blustering
winter with some general success; in the house, up
and down. My wife, however, has been painfully upset
by my health. Last year, of course, was cruelly trying
to her nerves; Nice and HyÃ¨res are bad experiences;
and though she is not ill, the doctor tells me that prolonged
anxiety may do her a real mischief.</p>

<p>I feel a little old and fagged, and chary of speech, and
not very sure of spirit in my work; but considering what
a year I have passed, and how I have twice sat on Charon&rsquo;s
pierhead, I am surprising.</p>

<p>My father has presented us with a very pretty home
in this place, into which we hope to move by May. My
<i>Child&rsquo;s Verses</i> come out next week. <i>Otto</i> begins to appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
in April; <i>More New Arabian Nights</i> as soon as possible.
Moreover, I am neck deep in Wellington; also a story
on the stocks, <i>The Great North Road</i>. O, I am busy!
Lloyd is at college in Edinburgh. That is, I think, all
that can be said by way of news.</p>

<p>Have you read <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>? It contains many
excellent things; above all, the whole story of a
healthy boy&rsquo;s dealings with his conscience, incredibly well
done.</p>

<p>My own conscience is badly seared; a want of piety;
yet I pray for it, tacitly, every day; believing it, after
courage, the only gift worth having; and its want, in a
man of any claims to honour, quite unpardonable. The
tone of your letter seemed to me very sound. In these
dark days of public dishonour, I do not know that one
can do better than carry our private trials piously. What
a picture is this of a nation! No man that I can see, on
any side or party, seems to have the least sense of our
ineffable shame: the desertion of the garrisons. I tell my
little parable that Germany took England, and then there
was an Indian Mutiny, and Bismarck said: &ldquo;Quite right:
let Delhi and Calcutta and Bombay fall; and let the
women and children be treated Sepoy fashion,&rdquo; and
people say, &ldquo;O, but that is very different!&rdquo; And then I
wish I were dead. Millais (I hear) was painting Gladstone
when the news came of Gordon&rsquo;s death; Millais was
much affected, and Gladstone said, &ldquo;Why? <i>It is the
man&rsquo;s own temerity!</i>&rdquo; VoilÃ  le Bourgeois! le voilÃ  nu!
But why should I blame Gladstone, when I too am a
Bourgeois? when I have held my peace? Why did I
hold my peace? Because I am a sceptic: <i>i.e.</i> a Bourgeois.
We believe in nothing, Symonds; you don&rsquo;t, and
I don&rsquo;t; and these are two reasons, out of a handful
of millions, why England stands before the world dripping
with blood and daubed with dishonour. I will first try
to take the beam out of my own eye, trusting that even
private effort somehow betters and braces the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
atmosphere. See, for example, if England has shown (I
put it hypothetically) one spark of manly sensibility, they
have been shamed into it by the spectacle of Gordon.
Police-Officer Cole is the only man that I see to admire.
I dedicate my <i>New Arabs</i> to him and Cox, in default of
other great public characters.&mdash;Yours ever most affectionately,</p>

<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following refers to an edition of Gray, with notes and a
short prefatory Life by Mr. Gosse; and to the publication of the
<i>Child&rsquo;s Garden of Verses</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, March</i> 12, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;I was indeed much exercised how I
could be worked into Gray; and lo! when I saw it, the
passage seemed to have been written with a single eye
to elucidate the&mdash;worst?&mdash;well, not a very good poem of
Gray&rsquo;s. Your little life is excellent, clean, neat, efficient.
I have read many of your notes, too, with pleasure. Your
connection with Gray was a happy circumstance; it was
a suitable conjunction.</p>

<p>I did not answer your letter from the States, for what
was I to say? I liked getting it and reading it; I was
rather flattered that you wrote it to me; and then I&rsquo;ll
tell you what I did&mdash;I put it in the fire. Why? Well,
just because it was very natural and expansive; and
thinks I to myself, if I die one of these fine nights, this
is just the letter that Gosse would not wish to go into
the hands of third parties. Was I well inspired? And I
did not answer it because you were in your high places,
sailing with supreme dominion, and seeing life in a particular
glory; and I was peddling in a corner, confined
to the house, overwhelmed with necessary work, which I
was not always doing well, and, in the very mild form in
which the disease approaches me, touched with a sort of
bustling cynicism. Why throw cold water? How ape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
your agreeable frame of mind? In short, I held my
tongue.</p>

<p>I have now published on 101 small pages <i>The Complete
Proof of Mr. R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s Incapacity to Write Verse</i>,
in a series of graduated examples with table of contents.
I think I shall issue a companion volume of exercises:
&ldquo;Analyse this poem. Collect and comminate the ugly
words. Distinguish and condemn the <i>chevilles</i>. State Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s faults of taste in regard to the measure.
What reasons can you gather from this example for your
belief that Mr. S. is unable to write any other measure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They look ghastly in the cold light of print; but there
is something nice in the little ragged regiment for all;
the blackguards seem to me to smile, to have a kind of
childish treble note that sounds in my ears freshly; not
song, if you will, but a child&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>I was glad you enjoyed your visit to the States. Most
Englishmen go there with a confirmed design of patronage,
as they go to France for that matter; and patronage
will not pay. Besides, in this year of&mdash;grace, said I?&mdash;of
disgrace, who should creep so low as an Englishman?
&ldquo;It is not to be thought of that the flood&rdquo;&mdash;ah, Wordsworth,
you would change your note were you alive
to-day!</p>

<p>I am now a beastly householder, but have not yet
entered on my domain. When I do, the social revolution
will probably cast me back upon my dung heap. There
is a person called Hyndman whose eye is on me; his step
is beHynd me as I go. I shall call my house Skerryvore
when I get it: <span class="scs">SKERRYVORE</span>: <i>c&rsquo;est bon pour la poÃ©shie</i>.
I will conclude with my favourite sentiment: &ldquo;The world
is too much with me.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth, March</i> 13, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;Your success has been immense. I
wish your letter had come two days ago: <i>Otto</i>, alas! has
been disposed of a good while ago; but it was only day
before yesterday that I settled the new volume of Arabs.
However, for the future, you and the sons of the deified
Scribner are the men for me. Really they have behaved
most handsomely. I cannot lay my hand on the papers,
or I would tell you exactly how it compares with my
English bargain; but it compares well. Ah, if we had
that copyright, I do believe it would go far to make me
solvent, ill-health and all.</p>

<p>I wrote you a letter to the Rembrandt, in which I stated
my views about the dedication in a very brief form. It
will give me sincere pleasure, and will make the second
dedication I have received, the other being from John
Addington Symonds. It is a compliment I value much;
I don&rsquo;t know any that I should prefer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span></p>

<p>I am glad to hear you have windows to do; that is a
fine business, I think; but, alas! the glass is so bad
nowadays; realism invading even that, as well as the
huge inferiority of our technical resource corrupting every
tint. Still, anything that keeps a man to decoration is,
in this age, good for the artist&rsquo;s spirit.</p>

<p>By the way, have you seen James and me on the
novel? James, I think in the August or September&mdash;R.
L. S. in the December Longman. I own I think the
<i>Ã©cole bÃªte</i>, of which I am the champion, has the whip hand
of the argument; but as James is to make a rejoinder,
I must not boast. Anyway the controversy is amusing
to see. I was terribly tied down to space, which has
made the end congested and dull. I shall see if I can
afford to send you the April Contemporary&mdash;but I dare
say you see it anyway&mdash;as it will contain a paper of mine
on style, a sort of continuation of old arguments on art
in which you have wagged a most effective tongue. It
is a sort of start upon my Treatise on the Art of
Literature: a small, arid book that shall some day
appear.</p>

<p class="to">To P.G. Hamerton</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The work of his correspondent&rsquo;s which R. L. S. notices in the
following is the sumptuous volume <i>Landscape</i>: Seeley &amp; Co., 1885.
The passages specially referred to will be found pp. 46-62 of that
work.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bournemouth, March</i> 16, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HAMERTON</span>,&mdash;Various things have been reminding
me of my misconduct: First, Swan&rsquo;s application
for your address; second, a sight of the sheets of your
<i>Landscape</i> book; and last, your note to Swan, which he
was so kind as to forward. I trust you will never suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
me to be guilty of anything more serious than an idleness,
partially excusable. My ill-health makes my rate of life
heavier than I can well meet, and yet stops me from
earning more. My conscience, sometimes perhaps too
easily stifled, but still (for my time of life and the public
manners of the age) fairly well alive, forces me to perpetual
and almost endless transcriptions. On the back
of all this, my correspondence hangs like a thundercloud;
and just when I think I am getting through my troubles,
crack, down goes my health, I have a long, costly sickness,
and begin the world again. It is fortunate for me
I have a father, or I should long ago have died; but the
opportunity of the aid makes the necessity none the more
welcome. My father has presented me with a beautiful
house here&mdash;or so I believe, for I have not yet seen it,
being a cage bird but for nocturnal sorties in the garden.
I hope we shall soon move into it, and I tell myself that
some day perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing
you as our guest. I trust at least that you will take me
as I am, a thoroughly bad correspondent, and a man, a
hater, indeed, of rudeness in others, but too often rude
in all unconsciousness himself; and that you will never
cease to believe the sincere sympathy and admiration that
I feel for you and for your work.</p>

<p>About the <i>Landscape</i>, which I had a glimpse of while
a friend of mine was preparing a review, I was greatly
interested, and could write and wrangle for a year on
every page; one passage particularly delighted me, the
part about Ulysses&mdash;jolly. Then, you know, that is just
what I fear I have come to think landscape ought to be
in literature; so there we should be at odds. Or perhaps
not so much as I suppose, as Montaigne says it is a pot
with two handles, and I own I am wedded to the technical
handle, which (I likewise own and freely) you do well to
keep for a mistress. I should much like to talk with you
about some other points; it is only in talk that one gets
to understand. Your delightful Wordsworth trap I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
tried on two hardened Wordsworthians, not that I am not
one myself. By covering up the context, and asking
them to guess what the passage was, both (and both
are very clever people, one a writer, one a painter) pronounced
it a guide-book. &ldquo;Do you think it an unusually
good guide-book?&rdquo; I asked, and both said, &ldquo;No, not
at all!&rdquo; Their grimace was a picture when I showed the
original.</p>

<p>I trust your health and that of Mrs. Hamerton keep
better; your last account was a poor one. I was unable
to make out the visit I had hoped, as (I do not know if
you heard of it) I had a very violent and dangerous hemorrhage
last spring. I am almost glad to have seen death
so close with all my wits about me, and not in the customary
lassitude and disenchantment of disease. Even
thus clearly beheld I find him not so terrible as we suppose.
But, indeed, with the passing of years, the decay
of strength, the loss of all my old active and pleasant
habits, there grows more and more upon me that belief
in the kindness of this scheme of things, and the goodness
of our veiled God, which is an excellent and pacifying
compensation. I trust, if your health continues to trouble
you, you may find some of the same belief. But perhaps
my fine discovery is a piece of art, and belongs to a character
cowardly, intolerant of certain feelings, and apt to
self-deception. I don&rsquo;t think so, however; and when I
feel what a weak and fallible vessel I was thrust into
this hurly-burly, and with what marvellous kindness
the wind has been tempered to my frailties, I think I
should be a strange kind of ass to feel anything but
gratitude.</p>

<p>I do not know why I should inflict this talk upon you;
but when I summon the rebellious pen, he must go his
own way; I am no Michael Scott, to rule the fiend of
correspondence. Most days he will none of me; and
when he comes, it is to rape me where he will.&mdash;Yours

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;That is all right, and a good job.
About coming down, you cannot get into us for a while,
as you may imagine; we are in desperate vortex, and
everybody &rsquo;most dead. I have been two days in bed
with liver and slight bleeding.</p>

<p>Do you think you are right to send <i>Macaire</i> and the
<i>Admiral</i> about? Not a copy have I sent, nor (speaking
for myself personally) do I want sent. The reperusal of
the <i>Admiral</i>, by the way, was a sore blow; eh, God, man,
it is a low, black, dirty, blackguard, ragged piece: vomitable
in many parts&mdash;simply vomitable. Pew is in places
a reproach to both art and man. But of all that afterwards.
What I mean is that I believe in playing dark
with second and third-rate work. Macaire is a piece of
job-work, hurriedly bockled; might have been worse,
might have been better; happy-go-lucky; act it or-let-it-rot
piece of business. Not a thing, I think, to send in
presentations. Do not let us <i>gober</i> ourselves&mdash;and, above
all, not <i>gober</i> dam pot-boilers&mdash;and p.b.&rsquo;s with an obvious
flaw and hole in them, such as is our unrealised Bertrand
in this one. But of this also, on a meeting.</p>

<p>I am not yet done with my proofs, I am sorry to say;
so soon as I am, I must tackle <i>Kidnapped</i> seriously, or be
content to have no bread, which you would scarcely recommend.
It is all I shall be able to do to wait for the
Young Folk money, on which I&rsquo;ll have to live as best I
can till the book comes in.</p>

<p>Plays at that rate I do not think I can possibly look
at before July; so let that be a guide to you in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
views. July, or August, or September, or thereabouts:
these must be our times, whichever we attack. I think
you had better suspend a visit till we can take you in
and till I can speak. It seems a considerable waste of
money; above all, as just now I could not even offer you
meals with my woman in such a state of overwork. My
father and mother have had to go to lodgings.&mdash;Post.</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Bournemouth, March</i> 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;Much better, but rather unequal to do
what I ought, a common complaint. The change of
weather much helped me, not too soon.</p>

<p>I have thought as well as I could of what you said;
and I come unhesitatingly to the opinion that the stage
is only a lottery, must not be regarded as a trade, and
must never be preferred to drudgery. If money comes
from any play, let us regard it as a legacy, but never count
upon it in our income for the year. In other words, I
must go on and drudge at <i>Kidnapped</i>, which I hate, and
am unfit to do; and you will have to get some journalism
somehow. These are my cold and blighting sentiments.
It is bad enough to have to live by an art&mdash;but to think
to live by an art combined with commercial speculation&mdash;that
way madness lies.</p>

<p>Time is our only friend. The <i>Admiral</i>, pulled simply
in pieces and about half deleted, will act some day:
such is my opinion. I can no more.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="to">To William Archer</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>An anonymous review of the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>, appearing in March,
gave R. L. S. so much pleasure that he wrote (in the four words,
&ldquo;Now who are you?&rdquo;) to inquire the name of its writer, and learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
that it was Mr. Archer; with whom he had hitherto had no acquaintance.
He thereupon entered into friendly correspondence with his
critic.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Bournemouth, March</i> 29, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. ARCHER</span>,&mdash;Yes, I have heard of you and
read some of your work; but I am bound in particular
to thank you for the notice of my verses. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; I
said, throwing it over to the friend who was staying with
me, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth writing a book to draw an article like
that.&rdquo; Had you been as hard upon me as you were
amiable, I try to tell myself I should have been no blinder
to the merits of your notice. For I saw there, to admire
and to be very grateful for, a most sober, agile pen; an
enviable touch; the marks of a reader, such as one imagines
for one&rsquo;s self in dreams, thoughtful, critical, and kind;
and to put the top on this memorial column, a greater
readiness to describe the author criticised than to display
the talents of his censor.</p>

<p>I am a man <i>blasÃ©</i> to injudicious praise (though I hope
some of it may be judicious too), but I have to thank
you for <span class="sc">the best criticism I ever had</span>; and am therefore,
dear Mr. Archer, the most grateful critickee now
extant.</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I congratulate you on living in the corner of
all London that I like best. <i>Ã€ propos</i>, you are very right
about my voluntary aversion from the painful sides of
life. My childhood was in reality a very mixed experience,
full of fever, nightmare, insomnia, painful days
and interminable nights; and I can speak with less
authority of gardens than of that other &ldquo;land of counterpane.&rdquo;
But to what end should we renew these sorrows?
The sufferings of life may be handled by the very greatest
in their hours of insight; it is of its pleasures that our
common poems should be formed; these are the experiences
that we should seek to recall or to provoke; and I
say with Thoreau, &ldquo;What right have I to complain, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
have not ceased to wonder?&rdquo; and, to add a rider of
my own, who have no remedy to offer.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the dedication of an illustrated <i>Canterbury
Pilgrimage</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Summer</i> 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR AND MADAM</span>,&mdash;This horrible delay must be
forgiven me. It was not caused by any want of gratitude;
but by the desire to acknowledge the dedication
more suitably (and to display my wit) in a copy of verses.
Well, now I give that up, and tell you in plain prose,
that you have given me much pleasure by the dedication
of your graceful book.</p>

<p>As I was writing the above, I received a visit from
Lady Shelley, who mentioned to me that she was reading
Mrs. Pennell&rsquo;s <i>Mary Wollstonecraft</i> with pleasure. It is
odd how streams cross. Mr. Pennell&rsquo;s work I have, of
course, long known and admired: and I believe there
was once some talk, on the part of Mr. Gilder, that we
should work together; but the scheme fell through from
my rapacity; and since then has been finally rendered
impossible (or so I fear) by my health.</p>

<p>I should say that when I received the <i>Pilgrimage</i>, I
was in a state (not at all common with me) of depression;
and the pleasant testimony that my work had not all
been in vain did much to set me up again. You will
therefore understand, late as is the hour, with what sincerity
I am able to sign myself&mdash;Gratefully yours,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><span class="scs">MR. AND MRS. PENNELL</span>,&mdash;I see I should explain that
this is all in my own hand, I have not fobbed you off

<p>On the death of Professor Fleeming Jenkin, who in Stevenson&rsquo;s
early student days at Edinburgh had been both the warmest and
the wisest of his elder friends (died June 12, 1885).</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, June</i> 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN</span>,&mdash;You know how much and for
how long I have loved, respected, and admired him; I
am only able to feel a little with you. But I know how
he would have wished us to feel. I never knew a better
man, nor one to me more lovable; we shall all feel the
loss more greatly as time goes on. It scarce seems life
to me; what must it be to you? Yet one of the last
things that he said to me was, that from all these sad
bereavements of yours he had learned only more than
ever to feel the goodness and what we, in our feebleness,
call the support of God; he had been ripening so much&mdash;to
other eyes than ours, we must suppose he was ripe,
and try to feel it. I feel it is better not to say much
more. It will be to me a great pride to write a notice of
him: the last I can now do. What more in any way I
can do for you, please to think and let me know. For
his sake and for your own, I would not be a useless friend:
I know, you know me a most warm one; please command
me or my wife, in any way. Do not trouble to write to
me; Austin, I have no doubt, will do so, if you are, as I
fear you will be, unfit.</p>

<p>My heart is sore for you. At least you know what you
have been to him; how he cherished and admired you;
how he was never so pleased as when he spoke of you;
with what a boy&rsquo;s love, up to the last, he loved you. This
surely is a consolation. Yours is the cruel part&mdash;to survive;
you must try and not grudge to him his better
fortune, to go first. It is the sad part of such relations
that one must remain and suffer; I cannot see my poor
Jenkin without you. Nor you indeed without him; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
you may try to rejoice that he is spared that extremity.
Perhaps I (as I was so much his confidant) know even
better than you can do what your loss would have been
to him; he never spoke of you but his face changed; it
was&mdash;you were&mdash;his religion.</p>

<p>I write by this post to Austin and to the Academy.&mdash;Yours
most sincerely,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, June</i> 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN</span>,&mdash;I should have written sooner,
but we are in a bustle, and I have been very tired, though
still well. Your very kind note was most welcome to me.
I shall be very much pleased to have you call me Louis,
as he has now done for so many years. Sixteen, you
say? is it so long? It seems too short now; but of that
we cannot judge, and must not complain.</p>

<p>I wish that either I or my wife could do anything for
you; when we can, you will, I am sure, command us.</p>

<p>I trust that my notice gave you as little pain as was
possible. I found I had so much to say, that I preferred
to keep it for another place and make but a note in the
Academy. To try to draw my friend at greater length,
and say what he was to me and his intimates, what a
good influence in life and what an example, is a desire
that grows upon me. It was strange, as I wrote the note,
how his old tests and criticisms haunted me; and it
reminded me afresh with every few words how much I
owe to him.</p>

<p>I had a note from Henley, very brief and very sad.
We none of us yet feel the loss; but we know what he
would have said and wished.</p>

<p>Do you know that Dew Smith has two photographs of
him, neither very bad? and one giving a lively, though
not flattering air of him in conversation? If you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
not got them, would you like me to write to Dew and ask
him to give you proofs?</p>

<p>I was so pleased that he and my wife made friends;
that is a great pleasure. We found and have preserved
one fragment (the head) of the drawing he made and tore
up when he was last here. He had promised to come
and stay with us this summer. May we not hope, at
least, some time soon to have one from you?&mdash;Believe me,
my dear Mrs. Jenkin, with the most real sympathy, your
sincere friend,</p>

too obvious to mention. We have both been sick; but
to-day I am up, though with an aching back. But I
hope all will be better. Of your views, state, finances,

<p>In August of this year Stevenson made with his wife an excursion
to the west country (stopping at Dorchester on the way, for the
pleasure of seeing Mr. Thomas Hardy at home), and was detained
for several weeks at The New London inn, Exeter, by a bad fit of
hemorrhage. His correspondence is not resumed until the autumn.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, October</i> 22, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;I trust you are not annoyed with me
beyond forgiveness; for indeed my silence has been
devilish prolonged. I can only tell you that I have been
nearly six months (more than six) in a strange condition
of collapse, when it was impossible to do any work, and
difficult (more difficult than you would suppose) to write
the merest note. I am now better, but not yet my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
man in the way of brains, and in health only so-so. I
suppose I shall learn (I begin to think I am learning) to
fight this vast, vague feather-bed of an obsession that
now overlies and smothers me; but in the beginnings of
these conflicts, the inexperienced wrestler is always worsted,
and I own I have been quite extinct. I wish you to know,
though it can be no excuse, that you are not the only
one of my friends by many whom I have thus neglected;
and even now, having come so very late into the possession
of myself, with a substantial capital of debts, and
my work still moving with a desperate slowness&mdash;as a
child might fill a sandbag with its little handfuls&mdash;and my
future deeply pledged, there is almost a touch of virtue
in my borrowing these hours to write to you. Why I
said &ldquo;hours&rdquo; I know not; it would look blue for both
of us if I made good the word.</p>

<p>I was writing your address the other day, ordering a
copy of my next, <i>Prince Otto</i>, to go your way. I hope
you have not seen it in parts; it was not meant to be
so read; and only my poverty (dishonourably) consented
to the serial evolution.</p>

<p>I will send you with this a copy of the English edition
of the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>. I have heard there is some vile
rule of the post-office in the States against inscriptions; so
I send herewith a piece of doggerel which Mr. Bunner
may, if he thinks fit, copy off the fly-leaf.</p>

<p>Sargent was down again and painted a portrait of me
walking about in my own dining-room, in my own velveteen
jacket, and twisting as I go my own moustache; at one
corner a glimpse of my wife, in an Indian dress, and seated
in a chair that was once my grandfather&rsquo;s, but since
some months goes by the name of Henry James&rsquo;s&mdash;for it
was there the novelist loved to sit&mdash;adds a touch of poesy
and comicality. It is, I think, excellent, but is too eccentric
to be exhibited. I am at one extreme corner; my
wife, in this wild dress, and looking like a ghost, is at
the extreme other end; between us an open door exhibits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
my palatial entrance hall and a part of my respected
staircase. All this is touched in lovely, with that witty
touch of Sargent&rsquo;s; but, of course, it looks dam queer
as a whole.</p>

<p>Pray let me hear from you, and give me good news of
yourself and your wife, to whom please remember me.&mdash;Yours
most sincerely, my dear Low,</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><i>Prince Otto</i> was published in October of this year; and the
following refers to two reviews of it&mdash;one of them by Mr. Henley,
which to the writer&rsquo;s displeasure had been pruned by the editor before
printing; the other by a writer in the Saturday Review who declared
that Otto was &ldquo;a fool and a wittol,&rdquo; and could see nothing but
false style in the story of Seraphina&rsquo;s flight through the forest.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Autumn</i> 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;If there was any more praise in what you
wrote, I think [the editor] has done us both a service;
some of it stops my throat. What, it would not have
been the same if Dumas or Musset had done it, would it
not? Well, no, I do not think it would, do you know,
now; I am really of opinion it would not; and a dam
good job too. Why, think what Musset would have made
of Otto! Think how gallantly Dumas would have carried
his crowd through! And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t quarrel
with &mdash;&mdash;. It gives me much pleasure to see your work
there; I think you do yourself great justice in that
field; and I would let no annoyance, petty or justifiable,
debar me from such a market. I think you do good
there. Whether (considering our intimate relations) you
would not do better to refrain from reviewing me, I will
leave to yourself: were it all on my side, you could foresee
my answer; but there is your side also, where you must
be the judge.</p>

<p>As for the Saturday. Otto is no &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
is left in no doubt as to whether or not Seraphina was a
Messalina (though much it would matter, if you come to
that); and therefore on both these points the reviewer
has been unjust. Secondly, the romance lies precisely in
the freeing of two spirits from these court intrigues; and
here I think the reviewer showed himself dull. Lastly, if
Otto&rsquo;s speech is offensive to him, he is one of the large
class of unmanly and ungenerous dogs who arrogate and
defile the name of manly. As for the passages quoted, I
do confess that some of them reek Gongorically; they are
excessive, but they are not inelegant after all. However,
had he attacked me only there, he would have
scored.</p>

<p>Your criticism on Gondremark is, I fancy, right. I

<div class="quote">
<p>The paper referred to in this and the following letters is one
which Mr. Archer wrote over his own signature in the November
number of Time, a magazine now extinct.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, October</i> 28, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. ARCHER</span>,&mdash;I have read your paper with my
customary admiration; it is very witty, very adroit; it
contains a great deal that is excellently true (particularly
the parts about my stories and the description of me as
an artist in life); but you will not be surprised if I do
not think it altogether just. It seems to me, in particular,
that you have wilfully read all my works in terms
of my earliest; my aim, even in style, has quite changed
in the last six or seven years; and this I should have
thought you would have noticed. Again, your first
remark upon the affectation of the italic names; a practice
only followed in my two affected little books of travel,
where a typographical <i>minauderie</i> of the sort appeared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
me in character; and what you say of it, then, is quite
just. But why should you forget yourself and use these
same italics as an index to my theology some pages further
on? This is lightness of touch indeed; may I say, it is
almost sharpness of practice?</p>

<p>Excuse these remarks. I have been on the whole much
interested, and sometimes amused. Are you aware that
the praiser of this &ldquo;brave gymnasium&rdquo; has not seen a
canoe nor taken a long walk since &rsquo;79? that he is rarely
out of the house nowadays, and carries his arm in a sling?
Can you imagine that he is a back-slidden communist,
and is sure he will go to hell (if there be such an excellent
institution) for the luxury in which he lives? And
can you believe that, though it is gaily expressed, the
thought is hag and skeleton in every moment of vacuity
or depression? Can you conceive how profoundly I am
irritated by the opposite affectation to my own, when I
see strong men and rich men bleating about their sorrows
and the burthen of life, in a world full of &ldquo;cancerous
paupers,&rdquo; and poor sick children, and the fatally bereaved,
ay, and down even to such happy creatures as myself,
who has yet been obliged to strip himself, one after another,
of all the pleasures that he had chosen except smoking
(and the days of that I know in my heart ought to be
over), I forgot eating, which I still enjoy, and who sees
the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite
steadily around him? In my view, one dank, dispirited
word is harmful, a crime of <i>lÃ¨se-humanitÃ©</i>, a piece of acquired
evil; every gay, every bright word or picture, like every
pleasant air of music, is a piece of pleasure set afloat;
the reader catches it, and, if he be healthy, goes on his
way rejoicing; and it is the business of art so to send him,
as often as possible.</p>

<p>For what you say, so kindly, so prettily, so precisely,
of my style, I must in particular thank you; though even
here, I am vexed you should not have remarked on my
attempted change of manner: seemingly this attempt is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
still quite unsuccessful! Well, we shall fight it out on
this line if it takes all summer.</p>

<p>And now for my last word: Mrs. Stevenson is very
anxious that you should see me, and that she should
see you, in the flesh. If you at all share in these views,
I am a fixture. Write or telegraph (giving us time, however,
to telegraph in reply, lest the day be impossible),
and come down here to a bed and a dinner. What do you
say, my dear critic? I shall be truly pleased to see you;
and to explain at greater length what I meant by saying
narrative was the most characteristic mood of literature,
on which point I have great hopes I shall persuade you.&mdash;Yours
truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;My opinion about Thoreau, and the passage in
The Week, is perhaps a fad, but it is sincere and stable.
I am still of the same mind five years later; did you
observe that I had said &ldquo;modern&rdquo; authors? and will you
observe again that this passage touches the very joint of
our division? It is one that appeals to me, deals with
that part of life that I think the most important, and you,
if I gather rightly, so much less so? You believe in the
extreme moment of the facts that humanity has acquired
and is acquiring; I think them of moment, but still of
much less than those inherent or inherited brute principles
and laws that sit upon us (in the character of conscience)
as heavy as a shirt of mail, and that (in the
character of the affections and the airy spirit of pleasure)
make all the light of our lives. The house is, indeed, a
great thing, and should be rearranged on sanitary principles;
but my heart and all my interest are with the
dweller, that ancient of days and day-old infant man.</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt1">An excellent touch is p. 584. &ldquo;By instinct or design
he eschews what demands constructive patience.&rdquo; I believe
it is both; my theory is that literature must always

be most at home in treating movement and change;
hence I look for them.</p>

<p>I was delighted to hear you were keeping better; you
and Archer would agree, more shame to you! (Archer is
my pessimist critic.) Good-bye to all of you, with my
best love. We had a dreadful overhauling of my conduct
as a son the other night; and my wife stripped me of
my illusions and made me admit I had been a detestable
bad one. Of one thing in particular she convicted me in
my own eyes: I mean, a most unkind reticence, which
hung on me then, and I confess still hangs on me now,
when I try to assure you that I do love you.&mdash;Ever your
bad son,</p>

<p class="to">To Henry James</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, October</i> 28, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENRY JAMES</span>,&mdash;At last, my wife being at a
concert, and a story being done, I am at some liberty to
write and give you of my views. And first, many thanks
for the works that came to my sickbed. And second, and
more important, as to the <i>Princess</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_13" id="FnAnchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> Well, I think you
are going to do it this time; I cannot, of course, foresee,
but these two first numbers seem to me picturesque and
sound and full of lineament, and very much a new departure.
As for your young lady, she is all there; yes, sir,
you can do low life, I believe. The prison was excellent;
it was of that nature of touch that I sometimes achingly
miss from your former work; with some of the grime,
that is, and some of the emphasis of skeleton there is in
nature. I pray you to take grime in a good sense; it
need not be ignoble: dirt may have dignity; in nature
it usually has; and your prison was imposing.</p>

<p>And now to the main point: why do we not see you?
Do not fail us. Make an alarming sacrifice, and let us
see &ldquo;Henry James&rsquo;s chair&rdquo; properly occupied. I never
sit in it myself (though it was my grandfather&rsquo;s); it has
been consecrated to guests by your approval, and now
stands at my elbow gaping. We have a new room, too,
to introduce to you&mdash;our last baby, the drawing-room; it
never cries, and has cut its teeth. Likewise, there is a
cat now. It promises to be a monster of laziness and
self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>Pray see, in the November Time (a dread name for a
magazine of light reading), a very clever fellow, W. Archer,
stating his views of me; the rosy-gilled &ldquo;athletico-Ã¦sthete&rdquo;;
and warning me, in a fatherly manner, that a
rheumatic fever would try my philosophy (as indeed it
would), and that my gospel would not do for &ldquo;those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
are shut out from the exercise of any manly virtue save
renunciation.&rdquo; To those who know that rickety and
cloistered spectre, the real R. L. S., the paper, besides
being clever in itself, presents rare elements of sport.
The critical parts are in particular very bright and neat,
and often excellently true. Get it by all manner of means.</p>

<p>I hear on all sides I am to be attacked as an immoral
writer; this is painful. Have I at last got, like you, to
the pitch of being attacked? &rsquo;Tis the consecration I lack&mdash;and
could do without. Not that Archer&rsquo;s paper is an
attack, or what either he or I, I believe, would call one;
&rsquo;tis the attacks on my morality (which I had thought a
gem of the first water) I referred to.</p>

<p>Now, my dear James, come&mdash;come&mdash;come. The spirit
(that is me) says, Come; and the bride (and that is my
wife) says, Come; and the best thing you can do for us
and yourself and your work is to get up and do so right
away.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To William Archer</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth</i>] <i>October</i> 30, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. ARCHER</span>,&mdash;It is possible my father may be
soon down with me; he is an old man and in bad health
and spirits; and I could neither leave him alone, nor
could we talk freely before him. If he should be here
when you offer your visit, you will understand if I have
to say no, and put you off.</p>

<p>I quite understand your not caring to refer to things
of private knowledge. What still puzzles me is how you
(&ldquo;in the witness box&rdquo;&mdash;ha! I like the phrase) should
have made your argument actually hinge on a contention
which the facts answered.</p>

<p>I am pleased to hear of the correctness of my guess.
It is then as I supposed; you are of the school of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
generous and not the sullen pessimists; and I can feel
with you. I used myself to rage when I saw sick folk
going by in their Bath-chairs; since I have been sick
myself (and always when I was sick myself), I found life,
even in its rough places, to have a property of easiness.
That which we suffer ourselves has no longer the same
air of monstrous injustice and wanton cruelty that suffering
wears when we see it in the case of others. So we
begin gradually to see that things are not black, but
have their strange compensations; and when they draw
towards their worst, the idea of death is like a bed to lie
on. I should bear false witness if I did not declare life
happy. And your wonderful statement that happiness
tends to die out and misery to continue, which was what
put me on the track of your frame of mind, is diagnostic
of the happy man raging over the misery of others; it
could never be written by the man who had tried what
unhappiness was like. And at any rate, it was a slip of
the pen: the ugliest word that science has to declare is
a reserved indifference to happiness and misery in the
individual; it declares no leaning toward the black, no
iniquity on the large scale in fate&rsquo;s doings, rather a marble
equality, dread not cruel, giving and taking away and
reconciling.</p>

<p>Why have I not written my <i>Timon</i>? Well, here is my
worst quarrel with you. You take my young books as
my last word. The tendency to try to say more has
passed unperceived (my fault, that). And you make no
allowance for the slowness with which a man finds and
tries to learn his tools. I began with a neat brisk little
style, and a sharp little knack of partial observation; I
have tried to expand my means, but still I can only utter
a part of what I wish to say, and am bound to feel; and
much of it will die unspoken. But if I had the pen of
Shakespeare, I have no <i>Timon</i> to give forth. I feel kindly
to the powers that be; I marvel they should use me so
well; and when I think of the case of others, I wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
too, but in another vein, whether they may not, whether
they must not, be like me, still with some compensation,
some delight. To have suffered, nay, to suffer, sets a keen
edge on what remains of the agreeable. This is a great
truth, and has to be learned in the fire.&mdash;Yours very
truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1">We expect you, remember that.</p>


<p class="to">To William Archer</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, November</i> 1, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. ARCHER</span>,&mdash;You will see that I had already
had a sight of your article and what were my thoughts.</p>

<p>One thing in your letter puzzles me. Are you, too, not
in the witness-box? And if you are, why take a wilfully
false hypothesis? If you knew I was a chronic invalid,
why say that my philosophy was unsuitable to such a
case? My call for facts is not so general as yours, but
an essential fact should not be put the other way
about.</p>

<p>The fact is, consciously or not, you doubt my honesty;
you think I am making faces, and at heart disbelieve my
utterances. And this I am disposed to think must spring
from your not having had enough of pain, sorrow, and
trouble in your existence. It is easy to have too much;
easy also or possible to have too little; enough is required
that a man may appreciate what elements of consolation
and joy there are in everything but absolutely overpowering
physical pain or disgrace, and how in almost
all circumstances the human soul can play a fair part.
You fear life, I fancy, on the principle of the hand of
little employment. But perhaps my hypothesis is as
unlike the truth as the one you chose. Well, if it be so,
if you have had trials, sickness, the approach of death,
the alienation of friends, poverty at the heels, and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
not felt your soul turn round upon these things and spurn
them under&mdash;you must be very differently made from
me, and I earnestly believe from the majority of men.
But at least you are in the right to wonder and
complain.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;say all&rdquo;? Stay here. All at once? That would
require a word from the pen of Gargantua. We say each
particular thing as it comes up, and &ldquo;with that sort of
emphasis that for the time there seems to be no other.&rdquo;
Words will not otherwise serve us; no, nor even Shakespeare,
who could not have put <i>As You Like It</i> and <i>Timon</i>
into one without ruinous loss both of emphasis and substance.
Is it quite fair then to keep your face so steadily
On my most light-hearted works, and then say I recognise
no evil? Yet in the paper on Burns, for instance, I show
myself alive to some sorts of evil. But then, perhaps,
they are not your sorts.</p>

<p>And again: &ldquo;to say all&rdquo;? All: yes. Everything:
no. The task were endless, the effect nil. But my all,
in such a vast field as this of life, is what interests me,
what stands out, what takes on itself a presence for my
imagination or makes a figure in that little tricky abbreviation
which is the best that my reason can conceive.
That I must treat, or I shall be fooling with my readers.
That, and not the all of some one else.</p>

<p>And here we come to the division: not only do I believe
that literature should give joy, but I see a universe,
I suppose, eternally different from yours; a solemn, a
terrible, but a very joyous and noble universe, where
suffering is not at least wantonly inflicted, though it falls
with dispassionate partiality, but where it may be and
generally is nobly borne; where, above all (this I believe;
probably you don&rsquo;t: I think he may, with cancer), <i>any
brave man may make</i> out a life which shall be happy for
himself, and, by so being, beneficent to those about him.
And if he fails, why should I hear him weeping? I mean
if I fail, why should I weep? Why should <i>you</i> hear <i>me</i>?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
Then to me morals, the conscience, the affections, and
the passions are, I will own frankly and sweepingly, so
infinitely more important than the other parts of life,
that I conceive men rather triflers who become immersed
in the latter; and I will always think the man who keeps
his lip stiff, and makes &ldquo;a happy fireside clime,&rdquo; and
carries a pleasant face about to friends and neighbours,
infinitely greater (in the abstract) than an atrabilious
Shakespeare or a backbiting Kant or Darwin. No offence
to any of these gentlemen, two of whom probably (one
for certain) came up to my standard.</p>

<p>And now enough said; it were hard if a poor man
could not criticise another without having so much ink
shed against him. But I shall still regret you should have
written on an hypothesis you knew to be untenable, and
that you should thus have made your paper, for those who
do not know me, essentially unfair. The rich, fox-hunting
squire speaks with one voice; the sick man of letters with
another.&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt1">Robert Louis Stevenson</p>
<p class="sc rt">(<i>Prometheus-Heine in minimis</i>).</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Here I go again. To me, the medicine bottles
on my chimney and the blood on my handkerchief are
accidents; they do not colour my view of life, as you
would know, I think, if you had experience of sickness;
they do not exist in my prospect; I would as soon drag
them under the eyes of my readers as I would mention
a pimple I might chance to have (saving your presence)
on my posteriors. What does it prove? what does it
change? it has not hurt, it has not changed me in any
essential part; and I should think myself a trifler and in
bad taste if I introduced the world to these unimportant
privacies.</p>

<p>But, again, there is this mountain-range between us&mdash;<i>that
you do not believe me</i>. It is not flattering, but the
fault is probably in my literary art.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;<i>Lamia</i> has not yet turned up, but
your letter came to me this evening with a scent of the
Boulevard Montparnasse that was irresistible. The sand
of Lavenue&rsquo;s crumbled under my heel; and the bouquet
of the old Fleury came back to me, and I remembered the
day when I found a twenty franc piece under my fetish.
Have you that fetish still? and has it brought you luck?
I remembered, too, my first sight of you in a frock-coat
and a smoking-cap, when we passed the evening at the
CafÃ© de Medicis; and my last when we sat and talked
in the Parc Monceau; and all these things made me feel
a little young again, which, to one who has been mostly
in bed for a month, was a vivifying change.</p>

<p>Yes, you are lucky to have a bag that holds you comfortably.
Mine is a strange contrivance; I don&rsquo;t die,
damme, and I can&rsquo;t get along on both feet to save my
soul; I am a chronic sickist; and my work cripples along
between bed and the parlour, between the medicine bottle
and the cupping glass. Well, I like my life all the same;
and should like it none the worse if I could have another
talk with you, though even my talks now are measured out
to me by the minute hand like poisons in a minim glass.</p>

<p>A photograph will be taken of my ugly mug and sent
to you for ulterior purposes: I have another thing coming
out, which I did not put in the way of the Scribners, I
can scarce tell how; but I was sick and penniless and
rather back on the world, and mismanaged it. I trust
they will forgive me.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear of Mrs. Low&rsquo;s illness, and glad to
hear of her recovery. I will announce the coming <i>Lamia</i>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR KINNICUM</span>,<a name="FnAnchor_14" id="FnAnchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>&mdash;I am a very bad dog, but not
for the first time. Your book, which is very interesting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
came duly; and I immediately got a very bad cold indeed,
and have been fit for nothing whatever. I am a bit better
now, and aye on the mend; so I write to tell you, I thought
of you on New Year&rsquo;s Day; though, I own, it would have
been more decent if I had thought in time for you to get
my letter then. Well, what can&rsquo;t be cured must be
endured, Mr. Lawrie; and you must be content with what
I give. If I wrote all the letters I ought to write, and
at the proper time, I should be very good and very happy;
but I doubt if I should do anything else.</p>

<p>I suppose you will be in town for the New Year; and
I hope your health is pretty good. What you want is
diet; but it is as much use to tell you that as it is to
tell my father. And I quite admit a diet is a beastly
thing. I doubt, however, if it be as bad as not being
allowed to speak, which I have tried fully, and do not
like. When, at the same time, I was not allowed to read,
it passed a joke. But these are troubles of the past, and
on this day, at least, it is proper to suppose they won&rsquo;t
return. But we are not put here to enjoy ourselves: it
was not God&rsquo;s purpose; and I am prepared to argue, it
is not our sincere wish. As for our deserts, the less said
of them the better, for somebody might hear, and nobody
cares to be laughed at. A good man is a very noble thing
to see, but not to himself; what he seems to God is,
fortunately, not our business; that is the domain of
faith; and whether on the first of January or the thirty-first
of December, faith is a good word to end on.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR PEOPLE</span>,&mdash;Many happy returns of the day to
you all; I am fairly well and in good spirits; and much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
and hopefully occupied with dear Jenkin&rsquo;s life. The inquiry
in every detail, every letter that I read, makes me
think of him more nobly. I cannot imagine how I got
his friendship; I did not deserve it. I believe the notice
will be interesting and useful.</p>

<p>My father&rsquo;s last letter, owing to the use of a quill pen
and the neglect of blotting-paper, was hopelessly illegible.
Every one tried, and every one failed to decipher an
important word on which the interest of one whole clause
(and the letter consisted of two) depended.</p>

<p>I find I can make little more of this; but I&rsquo;ll spare
the blots.&mdash;Dear people, ever your loving son,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt1">I will try again, being a giant refreshed by the house
being empty. The presence of people is the great obstacle
to letter-writing. I deny that letters should contain news
(I mean mine; those of other people should). But mine
should contain appropriate sentiments and humorous nonsense,
or nonsense without the humour. When the house
is empty, the mind is seized with a desire&mdash;no, that is
too strong&mdash;a willingness to pour forth unmitigated rot,
which constitutes (in me) the true spirit of correspondence.
When I have no remarks to offer (and nobody to
offer them to), my pen flies, and you see the remarkable
consequence of a page literally covered with words and
genuinely devoid of sense. I can always do that, if quite
alone, and I like doing it; but I have yet to learn that
it is beloved by correspondents. The deuce of it is, that
there is no end possible but the end of the paper; and
as there is very little left of that&mdash;if I cannot stop writing&mdash;suppose
you give up reading. It would all come to the
same thing; and I think we should all be happier....</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In the following letter R. L. S. accepts the dedication of Mr.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
the newly published <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i>, and a set of verses afterwards
printed in the Century Magazine and <i>Underwoods</i>, and inscribed
by Mr. St. Gaudens on his medallion portrait of the author. The
terms of the <i>Lamia</i> dedication are as follows: &ldquo;In testimony of
loyal friendship and of a common faith in doubtful tales from
Faery-Land, I dedicate to Robert Louis Stevenson my work in this
book.&rdquo; The Latin legend inscribed above the design runs: &ldquo;Neque
est ullum certius amicitiae vinculum quam consensus et societas
consiliorum et voluntatum.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth</i>] <i>Jan. 2nd,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;<i>Lamia</i> has come, and I do not know
how to thank you, not only for the beautiful art of the
designs, but for the handsome and apt words of the dedication.
My favourite is &ldquo;Bathes unseen,&rdquo; which is a
masterpiece; and the next, &ldquo;Into the green recessed
woods,&rdquo; is perhaps more remarkable, though it does not
take my fancy so imperiously. The night scene at Corinth
pleases me also. The second part offers fewer opportunities.
I own I should like to see both <i>Isabella</i> and the
<i>Eve</i> thus illustrated; and then there&rsquo;s <i>Hyperion</i>&mdash;O, yes,
and <i>Endymion</i>! I should like to see the lot: beautiful
pictures dance before me by hundreds: I believe <i>Endymion</i>
would suit you best. It also is in faery-land; and I see
a hundred opportunities, cloudy and flowery glories, things
as delicate as the cobweb in the bush; actions, not in
themselves of any mighty purport, but made for the
pencil: the feast of Pan, Peona&rsquo;s isle, the &ldquo;slabbed
margin of a well,&rdquo; the chase of the butterfly, the nymph,
Glaucus, Cybele, Sleep on his couch, a farrago of unconnected
beauties. But I divagate; and all this sits in the
bosom of the publisher.</p>

<p>What is more important, I accept the terms of the
dedication with a frank heart, and the terms of your Latin
legend fairly. The sight of your pictures has once more
awakened me to my right mind; something may come
of it; yet one more bold push to get free of this prison-yard
of the abominably ugly, where I take my daily exercise
with my contemporaries. I do not know, I have a
feeling in my bones, a sentiment which may take on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
forms of imagination, or may not. If it does, I shall owe
it to you; and the thing will thus descend from Keats
even if on the wrong side of the blanket. If it can be
done in prose&mdash;that is the puzzle&mdash;I divagate again.
Thank you again: you can draw and yet you do not
love the ugly: what are you doing in this age? Flee,
while it is yet time; they will have your four limbs pinned
upon a stable door to scare witches. The ugly, my unhappy
friend, is <i>de rigueur</i>: it is the only wear! What
a chance you threw away with the serpent! Why had
Apollonius no pimples? Heavens, my dear Low, you do
not know your business....</p>

<p>I send you herewith a Gothic gnome for your Greek
nymph; but the gnome is interesting, I think, and he
came out of a deep mine, where he guards the fountain
of tears. It is not always the time to rejoice.&mdash;Yours
ever,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="pt1">The gnome&rsquo;s name is <i>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</i>; I believe you
will find he is likewise quite willing to answer to the name
of Low or Stevenson.</p>

<p><i>Same day.</i>&mdash;I have copied out on the other sheet some
bad verses, which somehow your picture suggested; as a
kind of image of things that I pursue and cannot reach,
and that you seem&mdash;no, not to have reached&mdash;but to have
come a thought nearer to than I. This is the life we
have chosen: well, the choice was mad, but I should
make it again.</p>

<p>What occurs to me is this: perhaps they might be
printed in (say) the Century for the sake of my
name; and if that were possible, they might advertise
your book. It might be headed as sent in acknowledgment
of your <i>Lamia</i>. Or perhaps it might be introduced
by the phrases I have marked above. I dare say
they would stick it in: I want no payment, being
well paid by <i>Lamia</i>. If they are not, keep them to
yourself.</p>

<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Jan. 2nd,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;Thank you for your letter, so interesting
to my vanity. There is a review in the St. James&rsquo;s,
which, as it seems to hold somewhat of your opinions,
and is besides written with a pen and not a poker, we
think may possibly be yours. The <i>Prince</i><a name="FnAnchor_16" id="FnAnchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> has done
fairly well in spite of the reviews, which have been bad:
he was, as you doubtless saw, well slated in the Saturday;
one paper received it as a child&rsquo;s story; another (picture
my agony) described it as a &ldquo;Gilbert comedy.&rdquo; It was
amusing to see the race between me and Justin M&rsquo;Carthy:
the Milesian has won by a length.</p>

<p>That is the hard part of literature. You aim high, and
you take longer over your work, and it will not be so successful
as if you had aimed low and rushed it. What the
public likes is work (of any kind) a little loosely executed;
so long as it is a little wordy, a little slack, a little dim
and knotless, the dear public likes it; it should (if possible)
be a little dull into the bargain. I know that good work
sometimes hits; but, with my hand on my heart, I think
it is by an accident. And I know also that good work
must succeed at last; but that is not the doing of the
public; they are only shamed into silence or affectation.
I do not write for the public; I do write for money, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
nobler deity; and most of all for myself, not perhaps
any more noble, but both more intelligent and nearer
home.</p>

<p>Let us tell each other sad stories of the bestiality of
the beast whom we feed. What he likes is the newspaper;
and to me the press is the mouth of a sewer, where
lying is professed as from an university chair, and everything
prurient, and ignoble, and essentially dull, finds its
abode and pulpit. I do not like mankind; but men, and
not all of these&mdash;and fewer women. As for respecting the
race, and, above all, that fatuous rabble of burgesses
called &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; God save me from such irreligion!&mdash;that
way lies disgrace and dishonour. There
must be something wrong in me, or I would not be
popular.</p>

<p>This is perhaps a trifle stronger than my sedate and
permanent opinion. Not much, I think. As for the art
that we practise, I have never been able to see why its
professors should be respected. They chose the primrose
path; when they found it was not all primroses, but
some of it brambly, and much of it uphill, they began
to think and to speak of themselves as holy martyrs.
But a man is never martyred in any honest sense in the
pursuit of his pleasure; and <i>delirium tremens</i> has more
of the honour of the cross. We were full of the pride of
life, and chose, like prostitutes, to live by a pleasure. We
should be paid if we give the pleasure we pretend to give;
but why should we be honoured?</p>

<p>I hope some day you and Mrs. Gosse will come for a
Sunday; but we must wait till I am able to see people.
I am very full of Jenkin&rsquo;s life; it is painful, yet very
pleasant, to dig into the past of a dead friend, and find
him, at every spadeful, shine brighter. I own, as I read,
I wonder more and more why he should have taken me
to be a friend. He had many and obvious faults upon
the face of him; the heart was pure gold. I feel it little
pain to have lost him, for it is a loss in which I cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
believe; I take it, against reason, for an absence; if not
to-day, then to-morrow, I still fancy I shall see him in the
door; and then, now when I know him better, how glad
a meeting! Yes, if I could believe in the immortality
business, the world would indeed be too good to be true;
but we were put here to do what service we can, for honour
and not for hire: the sods cover us, and the worm that
never dies, the conscience, sleeps well at last; these are
the wages, besides what we receive so lavishly day by
day; and they are enough for a man who knows his
own frailty and sees all things in the proportion of reality.
The soul of piety was killed long ago by that idea of reward.
Nor is happiness, whether eternal or temporal, the reward
that mankind seeks. Happinesses are but his wayside
campings; his soul is in the journey; he was born for
the struggle, and only tastes his life in effort and on the
condition that he is opposed. How, then, is such a creature,
so fiery, so pugnacious, so made up of discontent and
aspiration, and such noble and uneasy passions&mdash;how can
he be rewarded but by rest? I would not say it aloud;
for man&rsquo;s cherished belief is that he loves that happiness
which he continually spurns and passes by; and this
belief in some ulterior happiness exactly fits him. He
does not require to stop and taste it; he can be about
the rugged and bitter business where his heart lies; and
yet he can tell himself this fairy tale of an eternal tea-party,
and enjoy the notion that he is both himself
and something else; and that his friends will yet meet
him, all ironed out and emasculate, and still be lovable,&mdash;as
if love did not live in the faults of the beloved only,
and draw its breath in an unbroken round of forgiveness!
But the truth is, we must fight until we die; and when
we die there can be no quiet for mankind but complete
resumption into&mdash;what?&mdash;God, let us say&mdash;when all these
desperate tricks will lie spellbound at last.</p>

<p class="to">To James Payn</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The late Mrs. Buckle, a daughter of Mr. James Payn married to
the editor of the Times, had laughingly remonstrated, through her
father, on recognising some features of her own house in Queen
Square, Bloomsbury, in the description of that tenanted by the
fair Cuban in the section of Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Dynamiter</i> which tells
the story of the Brown Box.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Jan. 2nd,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR JAMES PAYN</span>,&mdash;Your very kind letter came very
welcome; and still more welcome the news that you see
&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s tale. I will now tell you (and it was very good
and very wise of me not to tell it before) that he is one
of the most unlucky men I know, having put all his money
into a pharmacy at HyÃ¨res, when the cholera (certainly
not his fault) swept away his customers in a body. Thus
you can imagine the pleasure I have to announce to him
a spark of hope, for he sits to-day in his pharmacy, doing
nothing and taking nothing, and watching his debts
inexorably mount up.</p>

<p>To pass to other matters: your hand, you are perhaps
aware, is not one of those that can be read running; and
the name of your daughter remains for me undecipherable.
I call her, then, your daughter&mdash;and a very good
name too&mdash;and I beg to explain how it came about that
I took her house. The hospital was a point in my tale;
but there is a house on each side. Now the true house
is the one before the hospital: is that No. 11? If not,
what do you complain of? If it is, how can I help what
is true? Everything in the <i>Dynamiter</i> is not true; but
the story of the Brown Box is, in almost every particular;
I lay my hand on my heart and swear to it. It took place
in that house in 1884; and if your daughter was in that
house at the time, all I can say is she must have kept very
bad society.</p>

<p>But I see you coming. Perhaps your daughter&rsquo;s house
has not a balcony at the back? I cannot answer for that;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
I only know that side of Queen Square from the pavement
and the back windows of Brunswick Row. Thence
I saw plenty of balconies (terraces rather); and if there
is none to the particular house in question, it must have
been so arranged to spite me.</p>

<p>I now come to the conclusion of this matter. I address
three questions to your daughter:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>1st. Has her house the proper terrace?</p>
<p>2nd. Is it on the proper side of the hospital?</p>
<p>3rd. Was she there in the summer of 1884?</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>You see, I begin to fear that Mrs. Desborough may
have deceived me on some trifling points, for she is not
a lady of peddling exactitude. If this should prove to
be so, I will give your daughter a proper certificate, and
her house property will return to its original value.</p>

<p>Can man say more?&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<p>The late Sir Percy and Lady Shelley had in these days attached
themselves warmly to R. L. S., and saw in his ways and character
a living image of those of the poet, Sir Percy&rsquo;s father, as they
imagined him.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Jan. Somethingorother-th,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOW</span>,&mdash;I send you two photographs: they are
both done by Sir Percy Shelley, the poet&rsquo;s son, which may
interest. The sitting down one is, I think, the best; but
if they choose that, see that the little reflected light on
the nose does not give me a turn-up; that would be
tragic. Don&rsquo;t forget &ldquo;Baronet&rdquo; to Sir Percy&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span></p>

<p>We all think a heap of your book; and I am well
pleased with my dedication.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="sc rt">R. L. stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Apropos of the odd controversy about Shelley&rsquo;s
nose: I have before me four photographs of myself, done
by Shelley&rsquo;s son: my nose is hooked, not like the eagle,
indeed, but like the accipitrine family in man: well, out
of these four, only one marks the bend, one makes it
straight, and one suggests a turn-up. This throws a flood
of light on calumnious man&mdash;and the scandal-mongering
sun. For personally I cling to my curve. To continue
the Shelley controversy: I have a look of him, all his
sisters had noses like mine: Sir Percy has a marked
hook; all the family had high cheek-bones like mine;
what doubt, then, but that this turn-up (of which Jeaffreson
accuses the poet, along with much other <i>fatras</i>) is the
result of some accident similar to what has happened in
my photographs by his son?</p>

<p><i>Kidnapped</i> had at this time just been taken up again, and

</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, January</i> 25, 1886.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for a letter quite like
yourself. I quite agree with you, and had already planned
a scene of religion in <i>Balfour</i>; the Society for the Propagation
of Christian Knowledge furnishes me with a
catechist whom I shall try to make the man. I have
another catechist, the blind, pistol-carrying highway
robber, whom I have transferred from the Long Island to
Mull. I find it a most picturesque period, and wonder
Scott let it escape. The <i>Covenant</i> is lost on one of the
Tarrans, and David is cast on Earraid, where (being from
inland) he is nearly starved before he finds out the island
is tidal; then he crosses Mull to Toronsay, meeting the
blind catechist by the way; then crosses Morven from
Kinlochaline to Kingairloch, where he stays the night
with the good catechist; that is where I am; next day
he is to be put ashore in Appin, and be present at Colin
Campbell&rsquo;s death. To-day I rest, being a little run down.
Strange how liable we are to brain fag in this scooty
family! But as far as I have got, all but the last chapter,
I think David is on his feet, and (to my mind) a far better
story and far sounder at heart than <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>

<p>I have no earthly news, living entirely in my story,
and only coming out of it to play patience. The Shelleys
are gone; the Taylors kinder than can be imagined. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
other day, Lady Taylor drove over and called on me; she
is a delightful old lady, and great fun. I mentioned a
story about the Duchess of Wellington&mdash;which I had heard
Sir Henry tell; and though he was very tired, he looked
it up and copied it out for me in his own hand.&mdash;Your most
affectionate son,</p>

<p class="to">To C. W. Stoddard</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Feb. 13th,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR STODDARD</span>,&mdash;I am a dreadful character; but,
you see, I have at last taken pen in hand; how long I
may hold it, God knows. This is already my sixth letter
to-day, and I have many more waiting; and my wrist
gives me a jog on the subject of scrivener&rsquo;s cramp, which
is not encouraging.</p>

<p>I gather you were a little down in the jaw when you
wrote your last. I am as usual pretty cheerful, but not
very strong. I stay in the house all winter, which is base;
but, as you continue to see, the pen goes from time to
time, though neither fast enough nor constantly enough
to please me.</p>

<p>My wife is at Bath with my father and mother, and
the interval of widowery explains my writing. Another
person writing for you when you have done work is a great
enemy to correspondence. To-day I feel out of health,
and shan&rsquo;t work; and hence this so much over-due reply.</p>

<p>I was re-reading some of your <i>South Sea Idyls</i> the other
day: some of the chapters are very good indeed; some
pages as good as they can be.</p>

<p>How does your class get along? If you like to touch
on <i>Otto</i>, any day in a by-hour, you may tell them&mdash;as the
author&rsquo;s last dying confession&mdash;that it is a strange example
of the difficulty of being ideal in an age of realism; that the
unpleasant giddy-mindedness, which spoils the book and
often gives it a wanton air of unreality and juggling with air-bells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
comes from unsteadiness of key; from the too great
realism of some chapters and passages&mdash;some of which I have
now spotted, others I dare say I shall never spot&mdash;which
disprepares the imagination for the cast of the remainder.</p>

<p>Any story can be made <i>true</i> in its own key; any story
can be made <i>false</i> by the choice of a wrong key of detail
or style: <i>Otto</i> is made to reel like a drunken&mdash;I was going
to say man, but let us substitute cipher&mdash;by the variations
of the key. Have you observed that the famous problem
of realism and idealism is one purely of detail? Have
you seen my <i>Note on Realism</i> in Cassell&rsquo;s Magazine of
Art; and <i>Elements of Style</i> in the Contemporary; and
<i>Romance</i> and <i>Humble Apology</i> in Longman&rsquo;s? They are
all in your line of business; let me know what you have
not seen and I&rsquo;ll send &rsquo;em.</p>

<p>I am glad I brought the old house up to you. It was
a pleasant old spot, and I remember you there, though
still more dearly in your own strange den upon a hill in
San Francisco; and one of the most San Francisco-y parts
of San Francisco.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth</i> [<i>Spring</i> 1886].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SYMONDS</span>,&mdash;If we have lost touch, it is (I
think) only in a material sense; a question of letters, not
hearts. You will find a warm welcome at Skerryvore
from both the lightkeepers; and, indeed, we never tell
ourselves one of our financial fairy tales, but a run to
Davos is a prime feature. I am not changeable in friendship;
and I think I can promise you you have a pair of
trusty well-wishers and friends in Bournemouth: whether
they write or not is but a small thing; the flag may not
be waved, but it is there.</p>

<p><i>Jekyll</i> is a dreadful thing, I own; but the only thing
I feel dreadful about is that damned old business of the
war in the members. This time it came out; I hope it
will stay in, in future.</p>

<p>Raskolnikoff<a name="FnAnchor_17" id="FnAnchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> is easily the greatest book I have read
in ten years; I am glad you took to it. Many find it dull:
Henry James could not finish it: all I can say is, it nearly
finished me. It was like having an illness. James did not
care for it because the character of Raskolnikoff was not
objective; and at that I divined a great gulf between us,
and, on further reflection, the existence of a certain impotence
in many minds of to-day, which prevents them from
living in a book or a character, and keeps them standing
afar off, spectators of a puppet show. To such I suppose
the book may seem empty in the centre; to the others
it is a room, a house of life, into which they themselves
enter, and are tortured and purified. The Juge d&rsquo;Instruction
I thought a wonderful, weird, touching, ingenious
creation: the drunken father, and Sonia, and the student
friend, and the uncircumscribed, protoplasmic humanity
of Raskolnikoff, all upon a level that filled me with wonder:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
the execution also, superb in places. Another has been
translated&mdash;<i>HumiliÃ©s et OffensÃ©s</i>. It is even more incoherent
than <i>Le Crime et le ChÃ¢timent</i>, but breathes much
of the same lovely goodness, and has passages of power.
Dostoieffsky is a devil of a swell, to be sure. Have you
heard that he became a stout, imperialist conservative?
It is interesting to know. To something of that side, the
balance leans with me also in view of the incoherency
and incapacity of all. The old boyish idea of the march
on Paradise being now out of season, and all plans and
ideas that I hear debated being built on a superb indifference
to the first principles of human character, a helpless
desire to acquiesce in anything of which I know the worst
assails me. Fundamental errors in human nature of two
sorts stand on the skyline of all this modern world of
aspirations. First, that it is happiness that men want;
and second, that happiness consists of anything but an
internal harmony. Men do not want, and I do not think
they would accept, happiness; what they live for is
rivalry, effort, success&mdash;the elements our friends wish to
eliminate. And, on the other hand, happiness is a question
of morality&mdash;or of immorality, there is no difference&mdash;and
conviction. Gordon was happy in Khartoum, in his
worst hours of danger and fatigue; Marat was happy, I
suppose, in his ugliest frenzy; Marcus Aurelius was happy
in the detested camp; Pepys was pretty happy, and I am
pretty happy on the whole, because we both somewhat
crowingly accepted a <i>via media</i>, both liked to attend to
our affairs, and both had some success in managing the
same. It is quite an open question whether Pepys and I
ought to be happy; on the other hand, there is no doubt
that Marat had better be unhappy. He was right (if he
said it) that he was <i>la misÃ¨re humaine</i>, cureless misery&mdash;unless
perhaps by the gallows. Death is a great and
gentle solvent; it has never had justice done it, no, not by
Whitman. As for those crockery chimney-piece ornaments,
the bourgeois (<i>quorum pars</i>), and their cowardly dislike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
of dying and killing, it is merely one symptom of a thousand
how utterly they have got out of touch of life. Their
dislike of capital punishment and their treatment of their
domestic servants are for me the two flaunting emblems
of their hollowness.</p>

<p>God knows where I am driving to. But here comes
my lunch.</p>

<p>Which interruption, happily for you, seems to have
stayed the issue. I have now nothing to say, that had

But the wheels of Byles the Butcher drive exceeding
swiftly, and <i>Jekyll</i> was conceived, written, re-written, re-rewritten,

this white-hot haste would explain the gross error of
Hyde&rsquo;s speech at Lanyon&rsquo;s. Your point about the specialised

it.&mdash;About the picture, I rather meant that Hyde had

Now understand my state: I am really an invalid, but of

it since I was twelve, and first saw it from the train.</p>

<p>Lastly, it would depend on how I keep from now on.
I have stood the winter hitherto with some credit, but
the dreadful weather still continues, and I cannot holloa
till I am through the wood.</p>

<p>Subject to these numerous and gloomy provisos, I
embrace the prospect with glorious feelings.</p>

<p>I write this from bed, snow pouring without, and no
circumstance of pleasure except your letter. That, however,
counts for much. I am glad you liked the doggerel:
I have already had a liberal cheque, over which I licked
my fingers with a sound conscience. I had not meant to
make money by these stumbling feet, but if it comes, it is
only too welcome in my handsome but impecunious house.</p>

of health. Remember me to Madam with the best thanks

<div class="quote">
<p>Written just before a visit to London; not, this time, as my
guest at the British Museum, but to stay with his father at an
hotel in Fitzroy Square.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, March</i> 1886.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I have been reading the Vth and
VIth Aeneid&mdash;the latter for the first time&mdash;and am overpowered.
That is one of the most astonishing pieces of
literature, or rather it contains the best, I ever met with.
We are all damned small fry, and Virgil is one of the tops
of human achievement; I never appreciated this; you
should have a certain age to feel this; it is no book for
boys, who grind under the lack of enterprise and dash,
and pass ignorantly over miracles of performance that
leave an old hoary-headed practitioner like me stricken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
down with admiration. Even as a boy, the Sibyl would
have bust me; but I never read the VIth till I began it
two days ago; it is all fresh and wonderful; do you
envy me? If only I knew any Latin! if you had a decent
edition with notes&mdash;many notes&mdash;I should like well to
have it; mine is a damned Didot with not the ghost of
a note, type that puts my eyes out, and (I suspect) no
very splendid text&mdash;but there, the carnal feelings of the man
who can&rsquo;t construe are probably parents to the suspicion.</p>

<p>My dear fellow, I would tenfold rather come to the
Monument; but my father is an old man, and if I go to
town, it shall be (this time) for his pleasure. He has
many marks of age, some of childhood; I wish this knighthood
business could come off, though even the talk of it
has been already something, but the change (to my eyes)
is thoroughly begun; and a very beautiful, simple, honourable,
high-spirited and child-like (and childish) man is
now in process of deserting us piecemeal. <i>Si quis piorum</i>&mdash;God
knows, not that he was pious, but he did his hand&rsquo;s
darg or tried to do it; and if not,&mdash;well, it is a melancholy
business.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p>The first letter showing Stevenson&rsquo;s new interest in the technicalities
of music.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, March</i> 1886.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN</span>,&mdash;I try to tell myself it is good
nature, but I know it is vanity that makes me write.</p>

<p>I have drafted the first part of Chapter VI., Fleeming
and his friends, his influence on me, his views on religion
and literature, his part at the Savile; it should boil down
to about ten pages, and I really do think it admirably
good. It has so much evoked Fleeming for myself that
I found my conscience stirred just as it used to be after
a serious talk with him: surely that means it is good?
I had to write and tell you, being alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span></p>

<p>I have excellent news of Fanny, who is much better
for the change. My father is still very yellow, and very
old, and very weak, but yesterday he seemed happier,
and smiled, and followed what was said; even laughed,
I think. When he came away, he said to me, &ldquo;Take care
of yourself, my dearie,&rdquo; which had a strange sound of
childish days, and will not leave my mind.</p>

<p>You must get Litolf&rsquo;s <i>Gavottes CÃ©lÃ¨bres</i>: I have made
another trover there: a musette of Lully&rsquo;s. The second
part of it I have not yet got the hang of; but the first&mdash;only
a few bars! The gavotte is beautiful and pretty
hard, I think, and very much of the period; and at the
end of it, this musette enters with the most really thrilling
effect of simple beauty. O&mdash;it&rsquo;s first-rate. I am quite
mad over it. If you find other books containing Lully,
Rameau, Martini, please let me know; also you might
tell me, you who know Bach, where the easiest is to be
found. I write all morning, come down, and never leave
the piano till about five; write letters, dine, get down
again about eight, and never leave the piano till I go to
bed. This is a fine life.&mdash;Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt1">If you get the musette (Lully&rsquo;s), please tell me if I am
right, and it was probably written for strings. Anyway,
it is as neat as&mdash;as neat as Bach&mdash;on the piano; or seems
so to my ignorance.</p>

<p>I play much of the Rigadoon; but it&rsquo;s strange, it don&rsquo;t
come off <i>quite</i> so well with me!</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img style="border:0; width:550px; height:228px"
     src="images/img2.jpg"
     alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span></p>

<p>There is the first part of the musette copied (from
memory, so I hope there&rsquo;s nothing wrong). Is it not
angelic? But it ought, of course, to have the gavotte
before. The gavotte is in G, and ends on the keynote
thus (if I remember):&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter1">

     src="images/img3.jpg"
     alt="" />
</div>

<p class="noind">staccato, I think. Then you sail into the musette.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Where I have put an &ldquo;A&rdquo; is that a dominant
eleventh, or what? or just a seventh on the D? and if
the latter, is that allowed? It sounds very funny. Never
mind all my questions; if I begin about music (which is
my leading ignorance and curiosity), I have always to
babble questions: all my friends know me now, and take
no notice whatever. The whole piece is marked allegro;
but surely could easily be played too fast? The dignity
must not be lost; the periwig feeling.</p>

the long-eared British public may take to it, all think it
more than doubtful; I wish they would, for I could do a

it sin and folly to throw away David and Alan Breck
upon so small a field as this one.&mdash;Ever your affectionate

a lady correspondent in Chicago.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, May 25th,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MISS MONROE</span>,&mdash;(I hope I have this rightly) I
must lose no time in thanking you for a letter singularly
pleasant to receive. It may interest you to know that I
read to the signature without suspecting my correspondent
was a woman; though in one point (a reference to the
Countess) I might have found a hint of the truth. You
are not pleased with Otto; since I judge you do not like
weakness; and no more do I. And yet I have more than
tolerance for Otto, whose faults are the faults of weakness,
but never of ignoble weakness, and who seeks before
all to be both kind and just. Seeks, not succeeds. But
what is man? So much of cynicism to recognise that
nobody does right is the best equipment for those who do
not wish to be cynics in good earnest. Think better of
Otto, if my plea can influence you; and this I mean for
your own sake&mdash;not his, poor fellow, as he will never learn
your opinion; but for yours, because, as men go in this
world (and women too), you will not go far wrong if you
light upon so fine a fellow; and to light upon one and not
perceive his merits is a calamity. In the flesh, of course,
I mean; in the book the fault, of course, is with my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
stumbling pen. Seraphina made a mistake about her Otto;
it begins to swim before me dimly that you may have
some traits of Seraphina?</p>

<p>With true ingratitude you see me pitch upon your
exception; but it is easier to defend oneself gracefully
than to acknowledge praise. I am truly glad that you
should like my books; for I think I see from what you
write that you are a reader worth convincing. Your name,
if I have properly deciphered it, suggests that you may
be also something of my countrywoman; for it is hard to
see where Monroe came from, if not from Scotland. I
seem to have here a double claim on your good nature:
being myself pure Scotch and having appreciated your
letter, make up two undeniable merits which, perhaps, if
it should be quite without trouble, you might reward with
your photograph.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p class="to">To Miss Monroe</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, June</i> 1886.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS MONROE</span>,&mdash;I am ill in bed and stupid,
incoherently stupid; yet I have to answer your letter,
and if the answer is incomprehensible you must forgive
me. You say my letter caused you pleasure; I am sure,
as it fell out, not near so much as yours has brought to
me. The interest taken in an author is fragile: his next
book, or your next year of culture, might see the interest
frosted or outgrown; and himself, in spite of all, you
might probably find the most distasteful person upon
earth. My case is different. I have bad health, am often
condemned to silence for days together&mdash;was so once for
six weeks, so that my voice was awful to hear when I first
used it, like the whisper of a shadow&mdash;have outlived all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
my chief pleasures, which were active and adventurous,
and ran in the open air: and being a person who prefers
life to art, and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in
love, or to risk a danger, than to paint the finest picture
or write the noblest book, I begin to regard what remains
to me of my life as very shadowy. From a variety of
reasons, I am ashamed to confess I was much in this
humour when your letter came. I had a good many
troubles; was regretting a high average of sins; had been
recently reminded that I had outlived some friends, and
wondering if I had not outlived some friendships; and
had just, while boasting of better health, been struck
down again by my haunting enemy, an enemy who was
exciting at first, but has now, by the iteration of his strokes,
become merely annoying and inexpressibly irksome. Can
you fancy that to a person drawing towards the elderly
this sort of conjunction of circumstances brings a rather
aching sense of the past and the future? Well, it was
just then that your letter and your photograph were
brought to me in bed; and there came to me at once the
most agreeable sense of triumph. My books were still
young; my words had their good health and could go
about the world and make themselves welcome; and even
(in a shadowy and distant sense) make something in the
nature of friends for the sheer hulk that stays at home
and bites his pen over the manuscripts. It amused me
very much to remember that I had been in Chicago, not
so many years ago, in my proper person; where I had
failed to awaken much remark, except from the ticket
collector; and to think how much more gallant and
persuasive were the fellows that I now send instead of me,
and how these are welcome in that quarter to the sitter
of Herr Platz, while their author was not very welcome
even in the villainous restaurant where he tried to eat a
meal and rather failed.</p>

<p>And this leads me directly to a confession. The
photograph which shall accompany this is not chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
as the most like, but the best-looking. Put yourself in
my place, and you will call this pardonable. Even as
it is, even putting forth a flattered presentment, I am a
little pained; and very glad it is a photograph and not
myself that has to go; for in this case, if it please you,
you can tell yourself it is my image&mdash;and if it displease
you, you can lay the blame on the photographer; but in
that, there were no help, and the poor author might belie
his labours.</p>

<p><i>Kidnapped</i> should soon appear; I am afraid you may
not like it, as it is very unlike <i>Prince Otto</i> in every way;
but I am myself a great admirer of the two chief characters,
Alan and David. <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i> has never
been issued in the States. I do not think it is a book
that has much charm for publishers in any land; but I
am to bring out a new edition in England shortly, a copy
of which I must try to remember to send you. I say try
to remember, because I have some superficial acquaintance
with myself: and I have determined, after a galling
discipline, to promise nothing more until the day of my
death: at least, in this way, I shall no more break my
word, and I must now try being churlish instead of being
false.</p>

<p>I do not believe you to be the least like Seraphina.
Your photograph has no trace of her, which somewhat
relieves me, as I am a good deal afraid of Seraphinas&mdash;they
do not always go into the woods and see the sunrise,
and some are so well-mailed that even that experience
would leave them unaffected and unsoftened. The &ldquo;hair
and eyes of several complexions&rdquo; was a trait taken from
myself; and I do not bind myself to the opinions of Sir
John. In this case, perhaps&mdash;but no, if the peculiarity is
shared by two such pleasant persons as you and I (as
you and me&mdash;the grammatical nut is hard), it must be a
very good thing indeed, and Sir John must be an ass.</p>

<p>The Book Reader notice was a strange jumble of fact
and fancy. I wish you could have seen my father&rsquo;s old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
assistant and present partner when he heard my father
described as an &ldquo;inspector of lighthouses,&rdquo; for we are all
very proud of the family achievements, and the name of
my house here in Bournemouth is stolen from one of the
sea-towers of the Hebrides which are our pyramids and
monuments. I was never at Cambridge, again; but
neglected a considerable succession of classes at Edinburgh.
But to correct that friendly blunderer were to
write an autobiography.&mdash;And so now, with many thanks,
believe me yours sincerely,</p>

on a piece of paper, but scorned the act with a Threnody,
which was poured forth like blood and water on the

crystallised emotion, the statement and the reconciliation

of Bach&rsquo;s musette (Sweet Englishwoman,<a name="FnAnchor_18" id="FnAnchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> No. 3), the rest
of the musette being one prolonged cropper, which I take
daily for the benefit of my health. All my other works
(of which there are many) are either arranged (by R. L.

else prolonged and melancholy croppers.... I find one
can get a notion of music very nicely. I have been pickling
deeply in the Magic Flute; and have arranged <i>La

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, July 7th,</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR PEOPLE</span>,&mdash;It is probably my fault, and not
yours, that I did not understand. I think it would be
well worth trying the winter in Bournemouth; but I would
only take the house by the month&mdash;this after mature
discussion. My leakage still pursues its course; if I were
only well, I have a notion to go north and get in (if I
could) at the inn at Kirkmichael, which has always smiled
upon me much. If I did well there, we might then meet
and do what should most smile at the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, I must not move, and am in a
rancid box here, feeling the heat a great deal, and pretty
tired of things. Alexander did a good thing of me at
last; it looks like a mixture of an aztec idol, a lion, an
Indian Rajah, and a woman; and certainly represents
a mighty comic figure. F. and Lloyd both think
it is the best thing that has been done of me up to
now.</p>

<p>You should hear Lloyd on the penny whistle, and me
on the piano! Dear powers, what a concerto! I now
live entirely for the piano, he for the whistle; the neighbours,
in a radius of a furlong and a half, are packing up
in quest of brighter climes.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Please say if you can afford to let us have money
for this trip, and if so, how much. I can see the year
through without help, I believe, and supposing my health

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth</i>] <i>July</i> 28, 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;We have decided not to come to
Scotland, but just to do as Dobell wished, and take an
outing. I believe this is wiser in all ways; but I own it
is a disappointment. I am weary of England; like Alan,
&ldquo;I weary for the heather,&rdquo; if not for the deer. Lloyd has
gone to Scilly with Katharine and C., where and with
whom he should have a good time. <i>David</i> seems really
to be going to succeed, which is a pleasant prospect on
all sides. I am, I believe, floated financially; a book
that sells will be a pleasant novelty. I enclose another
review; mighty complimentary, and calculated to sell
the book too.</p>

<p>Coolin&rsquo;s tombstone has been got out, honest man! and
it is to be polished, for it has got scratched, and have a
touch of gilding in the letters, and be sunk in the front
of the house. Worthy man, he, too, will maybe weary
for the heather, and the bents of Gullane, where (as I dare
say you remember) he gaed clean gyte, and jumped on to
his crown from a gig, in hot and hopeless chase of many
thousand rabbits. I can still hear the little cries of the
honest fellow as he disappeared; and my mother will
correct me, but I believe it was two days before he turned
up again at North Berwick: to judge by his belly, he
had caught not one out of these thousands, but he had
had some exercise.</p>

<p class="to">To T. Watts-Dunton</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Written after his return from London and Paris.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth</i> [<i>September</i> 1886].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. WATTS</span>,&mdash;The sight of the last AthenÃ¦um
reminds me of you, and of my debt, now too long due.
I wish to thank you for your notice of <i>Kidnapped</i>; and
that not because it was kind, though for that also I valued
it, but in the same sense as I have thanked you before
now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers.
A critic like you is one who fights the good fight, contending
with stupidity, and I would fain hope not all in
vain; in my own case, for instance, surely not in vain.</p>

<p>What you say of the two parts in <i>Kidnapped</i> was felt
by no one more painfully than by myself. I began it
partly as a lark, partly as a pot-boiler; and suddenly it
moved, David and Alan stepped out from the canvas, and
I found I was in another world. But there was the cursed
beginning, and a cursed end must be appended; and our
old friend Byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping
at the back door. So it had to go into the world, one
part (as it does seem to me) alive, one part merely galvanised:
no work, only an essay. For a man of tentative
method, and weak health, and a scarcity of private means,
and not too much of that frugality which is the artist&rsquo;s
proper virtue, the days of sinecures and patrons look
very golden: the days of professional literature very
hard. Yet I do not so far deceive myself as to think I
should change my character by changing my epoch; the
sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to
the sum of virtues in ourselves; and my <i>Kidnapped</i> was
doomed, while still in the womb and while I was yet in
the cradle, to be the thing it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span></p>

<p>And now to the more genial business of defence. You
attack my fight on board the <i>Covenant</i>: I think it literal.
David and Alan had every advantage on their side&mdash;position,
arms, training, a good conscience; a handful of
merchant sailors, not well led in the first attack, not led
at all in the second, could only by an accident have taken
the round-house by attack; and since the defenders had
firearms and food, it is even doubtful if they could have
been starved out. The only doubtful point with me is
whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the
second onslaught; I half believe they would not; still the
illusion of numbers and the authority of Hoseason would
perhaps stretch far enough to justify the extremity.&mdash;I am,
dear Mr. Watts, your very sincere admirer,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, September</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CUMMY</span>,&mdash;I am home from a long holiday,
vastly better in health. My wife not home yet, as she is
being cured in some rather boisterous fashion by some
Swedish doctors. I hope it may do her good, as the process
seems not to be agreeable in itself.</p>

<p>Your cupboard has come, and it is most beautiful: it
is certainly worth a lot of money, and is just what we
have been looking for in all the shops for quite a while:
so your present falls very pat. It is to go in our bedroom
I think; but perhaps my wife will think it too much of
a good thing to be put so much out of the way, so I shall
not put it in its place till her return. I am so well that I
am afraid to speak of it, being a coward as to boasting.
I take walks in the wood daily, and have got back to my
work after a long break. The story I wrote you about
was one you read to me in Cassell&rsquo;s Family Paper long ago
when it came out. It was astonishing how clearly I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
remembered it all, pictures, characters, and incidents,
though the last were a little mixed and I had not the least
the hang of the story. It was very pleasant to read it

<p>To Mr. Locker&rsquo;s acknowledgment of these verses Stevenson
replied as follows, asking his correspondent&rsquo;s interest on behalf of
a friend who had been kind to him at HyÃ¨res, in procuring a
nomination for her son to the Blue-Coat School.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, September</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR LOCKER</span>,&mdash;You take my verses too kindly, but
you will admit, for such a bluebottle of a versifier to enter
the house of Gertrude, where her necklace hangs, was not
a little brave. Your kind invitation, I fear, must remain
unaccepted; and yet&mdash;if I am very well&mdash;perhaps next
spring&mdash;(for I mean to be very well)&mdash;my wife might....
But all that is in the clouds with my better health.
And now look here: you are a rich man and know many
people, therefore perhaps some of the Governors of Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital. If you do, I know a most deserving case, in
which I would (if I could) do anything. To approach you,
in this way, is not decent; and you may therefore judge
by my doing it, how near this matter lies to my heart. I
enclose you a list of the Governors, which I beg you to
return, whether or not you shall be able to do anything
to help me.</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s name is &mdash;&mdash;; he and his mother are very
poor. It may interest you in her cause if I tell you this:
that when I was dangerously ill at HyÃ¨res, this brave
lady, who had then a sick husband of her own (since dead)
and a house to keep and a family of four to cook for, all
with her own hands, for they could afford no servant,
yet took watch-about with my wife, and contributed not
only to my comfort, but to my recovery in a degree that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
I am not able to limit. You can conceive how much I
suffer from my impotence to help her, and indeed I have
already shown myself a thankless friend. Let not my cry

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, September</i> 1886.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LOCKER</span>,&mdash;That I should call myself a man
of letters, and land myself in such unfathomable
ambiguities! No, my dear Locker, I did not want a
cheque; and in my ignorance of business, which is greater
even than my ignorance of literature, I have taken the
liberty of drawing a pen through the document and returning
it; should this be against the laws of God or
man, forgive me. All that I meant by my excessively
disgusting reference to your material well-being was the
vague notion that a man who is well off was sure to know
a Governor of Christ&rsquo;s Hospital; though how I quite
arrived at this conclusion I do not see. A man with a
cold in the head does not necessarily know a ratcatcher;
and the connection is equally close&mdash;as it now appears to
my awakened and somewhat humbled spirit. For all that,
let me thank you in the warmest manner for your friendly
readiness to contribute. You say you have hopes of
becoming a miser: I wish I had; but indeed I believe
you deceive yourself, and are as far from it as ever. I
wish I had any excuse to keep your cheque, for it is much
more elegant to receive than to return; but I have my
way of making it up to you, and I do sincerely beg you
to write to the two Governors. This extraordinary out-pouring
of correspondence would (if you knew my habits)
convince you of my great eagerness in this matter. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
would promise gratitude; but I have made a promise to
myself to make no more promises to anybody else, having
broken such a host already, and come near breaking my
heart in consequence; and as for gratitude, I am by
nature a thankless dog, and was spoiled from a child up.
But if you can help this lady in the matter of the Hospital,
you will have helped the worthy. Let me continue to
hope that I shall make out my visit in the spring, and
believe me, yours very truly,</p>

cheque now, and act to that amount as your almoner.
In this way I reward myself for the ambiguity of my
epistolary style.</p>

<p>I suppose, if you please, you may say your verses are
thin (would you so describe an arrow, by the way, and
one that struck the gold? It scarce strikes me as exhaustively

very sincerely for the generous trouble you have taken in
this matter which was so near my heart, and you may be
very certain it will be the fault of my health and not my

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;This is first-rate of you, the Lord

very changeable; at times, he seems only a slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
quiet edition of himself; again, he will be very heavy
and blank; but never so violent as last spring; and
therefore, to my mind, better on the whole.</p>

<p>Fanny is pretty peepy; I am splendid. I have been
writing much verse&mdash;quite the bard, in fact; and also a
dam tale to order, which will be what it will be: I don&rsquo;t
love it, but some of it is passable in its mouldy way, <i>The
Misadventures of John Nicholson</i>. All my bardly exercises
are in Scotch; I have struck my somewhat ponderous
guitar in that tongue to no small extent: with what
success, I know not, but I think it&rsquo;s better than my English
verse; more marrow and fatness, and more ruggedness.</p>

<p>How goes <i>Keats</i>? Pray remark, if he (Keats) hung
back from Shelley, it was not to be wondered at, <i>when so
many of his friends were Shelley&rsquo;s pensioners</i>. I forget if
you have made this point; it has been borne in upon me
reading Dowden and the <i>Shelley Papers</i>; and it will do
no harm if you have made it. I finished a poem to-day,

time is ironical, too; and it would be like his irony if the
same tide that brought you back carried me away. That
would not be, at least, without some meeting.</p>

<p>I feel very sorry to think the book to which I have
put your name will be no better, and I can make it no
better. The tales are of all dates and places; they are
like the box, the goose, and the cottage of the ferryman;
and must go floating down time together as best they
can. But I am after all a (superior) penny-a-liner; I
must do, in the Scotch phrase, as it will do with me; and
I cannot always choose what my books are to be, only seize
the chance they offer to link my name to a friend&rsquo;s. I
hope the lot of them (the tales) will look fairly disciplined
when they are clapped in binding; but I fear they will
be but an awkward squad. I have a mild wish that you
at least would read them no further than the dedication.</p>

<p>I suppose we have all been reading Dowden. It seems
to me a really first-rate book, full of justice, and humour
without which there can be no justice; and of fine intelligence
besides. Here and there, perhaps a trifle precious,
but this is to spy flaws in a fine work. I was weary
at my resemblances to Shelley; I seem but a Shelley with
less oil, and no genius; though I have had the fortune
to live longer and (partly) to grow up. He was growing
up. There is a manlier note in the last days; in spite
of such really sickening aberrations as the Emillia Viviani
business. I try to take a humorously-genial view of life;
but Emillia Viviani, if I have her detested name aright,<a name="FnAnchor_19" id="FnAnchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
is too much for my philosophy. I cannot smile when I
see all these grown folk waltzing and piping the eye about
an insubordinate and perfectly abominable schoolgirl, as
silly and patently as false as Blanche Amory.<a name="FnAnchor_20" id="FnAnchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> I really
think it is one of those episodes that make the angels weep.</p>

<p>With all kind regards and affectionate good wishes to
and for you and yours, believe me, your affectionate
friend,</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The reference in the last paragraph to a &ldquo;vision&rdquo; cannot be
explained, his correspondent&rsquo;s daughters retaining no memory on
the subject.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, January</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LADY TAYLOR</span>,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know but what I
agree fairly well with all you say, only I like <i>The Merry
Men</i>, as a fantasia or vision of the sea, better than you
do. The trouble with <i>Olalla</i> is that it somehow sounds
false; and I think it must be this that gives you the feeling
of irreverence. Of <i>Thrawn Janet</i>, which I like very much
myself, you say nothing, thus uttering volumes; but it
is plain that people cannot always agree. I do not think
it is a wholesome part of me that broods on the evil in the
world and man; but I do not think that I get harm from
it; possibly my readers may, which is more serious; but at
any account, I do not purpose to write more in this vein.
But the odd problem is: what makes a story true? <i>Markheim</i>
is true; <i>Olalla</i> false; and I don&rsquo;t know why, nor
did I feel it while I worked at them; indeed I had more
inspiration with <i>Olalla</i>, as the style shows. I am glad you
thought that young Spanish woman well dressed; I admire
the style of it myself, more than is perhaps good for me;
it is so solidly written. And that again brings back
(almost with the voice of despair) my unanswerable: why
is it false?</p>

<p>Here is a great deal about my works. I am in bed
again; and my wife but so-so; and we have no news
recently from Lloyd; and the cat is well; and we see,
or I see, no one; so that other matters are all closed
against me.</p>

<p>Your vision is strange indeed; but I see not how to
use it; I fear I am earthy enough myself to regard it as
a case of disease, but certainly it is a thrilling case to
hear of.&mdash;Ever affectionately yours,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR JAMES</span>,&mdash;I send you the first sheets of the new
volume, all that has yet reached me, the rest shall follow
in course. I am really a very fair sort of a fellow all
things considered, have done some work; a silly Xmas
story (with some larks in it) which won&rsquo;t be out till I don&rsquo;t
know when. I am also considering a volume of verse,
much of which will be cast in my native speech, that very
dark oracular medium: I suppose this is a folly, but what
then? As the nurse says in Marryat, &ldquo;It was only a
little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My wife is peepy and dowie: two Scotch expressions
with which I will leave you to wrestle unaided, as a preparation
for my poetical works. She is a woman (as you
know) not without art: the art of extracting the gloom
of the eclipse from sunshine; and she has recently laboured
in this field not without success or (as we used to say)
not without a blessing. It is strange: &ldquo;we fell out my
wife and I&rdquo; the other night; she tackled me savagely for
being a canary-bird; I replied (bleatingly) protesting that
there was no use in turning life into King Lear; presently
it was discovered that there were two dead combatants
upon the field, each slain by an arrow of the truth, and
we tenderly carried off each other&rsquo;s corpses. Here is a
little comedy for Henry James to write! The beauty was
each thought the other quite unscathed at first. But we
had dealt shrewd stabs.</p>

<p>You say nothing of yourself, which I shall take to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
good news. Archer&rsquo;s note has gone. He is, in truth, a
very clever fellow that Archer, and I believe a good one.
It is a pleasant thing to see a man who can use a pen;
he can: really says what he means, and says it with a
manner; comes into print like one at his ease, not shame-faced
and wrong-foot-foremost like the bulk of us. Well,
here is luck, and here are the kindest recollections from
the canary-bird and from King Lear, from the Tragic
Woman and the Flimsy Man.</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I had lately sent him two books, the fifth volume of Huxley&rsquo;s
<i>Collected Essays</i> and Cotter Morison&rsquo;s <i>Service of Man</i>: the latter a
work of Positivist tendency, which its genial and accomplished
author had long meditated, but which unfortunately he only began
to write after a rapid decline of health and power had set in.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, Spring</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I read Huxley, and a lot of it with
great interest. Eh, what a gulf between a man with a
mind like Huxley and a man like Cotter Morison. Truly
&rsquo;tis the book of a boy; before I was twenty I was done
with all these considerations. Nor is there one happy
phrase, except &ldquo;the devastating flood of children.&rdquo; Why
should he din our ears with languid repetitions of the very
first ideas and facts that a bright lad gets hold of; and
how can a man be so destitute of historical perspective,
so full of cheap outworn generalisations&mdash;feudal ages,
time of suffering&mdash;<i>pas tant qu&rsquo;aujourdhui</i>, M. Cotter!
Christianity&mdash;which? what? how? You must not attack
all forms, from Calvin to St. Thomas, from St. Thomas
to (One who should surely be considered) Jesus Christ,
with the same missiles: they do not all tell against all.
But there it is, as we said; a man joins a sect, and becomes
one-eyed. He affects a horror of vices which are
just the thing to stop his &ldquo;devastating flood of babies,&rdquo; and
just the thing above all to keep the vicious from procreating.
Where, then, is the ground of this horror in any intelligent
Servant of Humanity? O, beware of creeds and anti-creeds,
sects and anti-sects. There is but one truth, outside
science, the truth that comes of an earnest, smiling
survey of mankind &ldquo;from China to Peru,&rdquo; or further, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
from to-day to the days of Probably Arboreal; and the
truth (however true it is) that robs you of sympathy with
any form of thought or trait of man, is false for you, and
heretical, and heretico-plastic. Hear Morison struggling
with his chains; hear me, hear all of us, when we suffer
our creeds or anti-creeds to degenerate towards the whine,
and begin to hate our neighbours, or our ancestors, like
ourselves. And yet in Morison, too, as in St. Thomas, as
in Rutherford, ay, or in Peden, truth struggles, or it would
not so deform them. The man has not a devil; it is an
angel that tears and blinds him. But Morison&rsquo;s is an old,
almost a venerable seraph, with whom I dealt before I was
twenty, and had done before I was twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAREST CUMMY</span>,&mdash;As usual, I have been a dreary
bad fellow and not written for ages; but you must just
try to forgive me, to believe (what is the truth) that the
number of my letters is no measure of the number of
times I think of you, and to remember how much writing
I have to do. The weather is bright, but still cold; and
my father, I&rsquo;m afraid, feels it sharply. He has had&mdash;still
has, rather&mdash;a most obstinate jaundice, which has reduced
him cruelly in strength, and really upset him altogether.
I hope, or think, he is perhaps a little better; but he
suffers much, cannot sleep at night, and gives John and
my mother a severe life of it to wait upon him. My wife
is, I think, a little better, but no great shakes. I keep
mightily respectable myself.</p>

also) is set just above it. Poor, unhappy wee man, he
died, as you must have heard, in fight, which was what he
would have chosen; for military glory was more in his
line than the domestic virtues. I believe this is about
all my news, except that, as I write, there is a blackbird
singing in our garden trees, as it were at Swanston. I
would like fine to go up the burnside a bit, and sit by
the pool and be young again&mdash;or no, be what I am still,
only there instead of here, for just a little. Did you see
that I had written about John Todd? In this month&rsquo;s
Longman it was; if you have not seen it, I will try and
send it you. Some day climb as high as Halkerside for
me (I am never likely to do it for myself), and sprinkle
some of the well water on the turf. I am afraid it is a
pagan rite, but quite harmless, and <i>ye can sain it wi&rsquo; a
bit prayer</i>. Tell the Peewies that I mind their forbears
well. My heart is sometimes heavy and sometimes glad
to mind it all. But for what we have received, the
Lord make us truly thankful. Don&rsquo;t forget to sprinkle
the water, and do it in my name; I feel a childish
eagerness in this.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following sets forth the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> which were balancing
each other in his mind in regard to his scheme of going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
to make a stand in his own person against agrarian outrage in
Ireland.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth</i>] <i>April 15 or 16<br />
(the hour not being known),</i> 1887.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN</span>,&mdash;It is I know not what hour
of the night; but I cannot sleep, have lit the gas, and
here goes.</p>

<p>First, all your packet arrived: I have dipped into the
Schumann already with great pleasure. Surely, in what
concerns us there is a sweet little chirrup; the <i>Good Words</i>
arrived in the morning just when I needed it, and the
famous notes that I had lost were recovered also in the
nick of time.</p>

<p>And now I am going to bother you with my affairs:
premising, first, that this is <i>private</i>; second, that whatever
I do the <i>Life</i> shall be done first, and I am getting on
with it well; and third, that I do not quite know why I
consult you, but something tells me you will hear with
fairness.</p>

<p>Here is my problem. The Curtin women are still
miserable prisoners; no one dare buy their farm of them,
all the manhood of England and the world stands aghast
before a threat of murder. (1) Now, my work can be
done anywhere; hence I can take up without loss a back-going
Irish farm, and live on, though not (as I had originally
written) in it: First Reason. (2) If I should be
killed, there are a good many who would feel it: writers
are so much in the public eye, that a writer being murdered
would attract attention, throw a bull&rsquo;s-eye light
upon this cowardly business: Second Reason. (3) I am
not unknown in the States, from which the funds come
that pay for these brutalities: to some faint extent, my
death (if I should be killed) would tell there: Third
Reason. (4) <i>Nobody else is taking up this obvious and
crying duty:</i> Fourth Reason. (5) I have a crazy health
and may die at any moment, my life is of no purchase
in an insurance office, it is the less account to husband it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
and the business of husbanding a life is dreary and demoralising:
Fifth Reason.</p>

<p>I state these in no order, but as they occur to me.
And I shall do the like with the objections.</p>

<p>First Objection: It will do no good; you have seen
Gordon die, and nobody minded; nobody will mind if you
die. This is plainly of the devil. Second Objection: You
will not even be murdered, the climate will miserably kill
you, you will strangle out in a rotten damp heat, in congestion,
etc. Well, what then? It changes nothing: the
purpose is to brave crime; let me brave it, for such time
and to such an extent as God allows. Third Objection:
The Curtin women are probably highly uninteresting
females. I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it. But the Government
cannot, men will not, protect them. If I am the only
one to see this public duty, it is to the public and the
Right I should perform it&mdash;not to Mesdames Curtin.
Fourth Objection: I am married. &ldquo;I have married a
wife!&rdquo; I seem to have heard it before. It smells ancient!
what was the context? Fifth Objection: My wife has
had a mean life (1), loves me (2), could not bear to lose
me (3). (1) I admit: I am sorry. (2) But what does
she love me for? and (3) she must lose me soon or late.
And after all, because we run this risk, it does not follow
we should fail. Sixth Objection: My wife wouldn&rsquo;t like
it. No, she wouldn&rsquo;t. Who would? But the Curtins
don&rsquo;t like it. And all those who are to suffer if this goes
on, won&rsquo;t like it. And if there is a great wrong, somebody
must suffer. Seventh Objection: I won&rsquo;t like it.
No, I will not; I have thought it through, and I will not.
But what of that? And both she and I may like it more
than we suppose. We shall lose friends, all comforts, all
society: so has everybody who has ever done anything;
but we shall have some excitement, and that&rsquo;s a fine thing;
and we shall be trying to do the right, and that&rsquo;s not to
be despised. Eighth Objection: I am an author with my
work before me. See Second Reason. Ninth Objection:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
But am I not taken with the hope of excitement? I was
at first. I am not much now. I see what a dreary, friendless,
miserable, God-forgotten business it will be. And
anyway, is not excitement the proper reward of doing
anything both right and a little dangerous? Tenth
Objection: But am I not taken with a notion of glory?
I dare say I am. Yet I see quite clearly how all points to
nothing coming, to a quite inglorious death by disease
and from the lack of attendance; or even if I should be
knocked on the head, as these poor Irish promise, how
little any one will care. It will be a smile at a thousand
breakfast-tables. I am nearly forty now; I have not
many illusions. And if I had? I do not love this health-tending,
housekeeping life of mine. I have a taste for
danger, which is human, like the fear of it. Here is a fair
cause; a just cause; no knight ever set lance in rest for
a juster. Yet it needs not the strength I have not, only
the passive courage that I hope I could muster, and the
watchfulness that I am sure I could learn.</p>

<p>Here is a long midnight dissertation; with myself;
with you. Please let me hear. But I charge you this:
if you see in this idea of mine the finger of duty, do not
dissuade me. I am nearing forty, I begin to love my ease
and my home and my habits, I never knew how much
till this arose; do not falsely counsel me to put my head
under the bed-clothes. And I will say this to you: my
wife, who hates the idea, does not refuse. &ldquo;It is nonsense,&rdquo;
says she, &ldquo;but if you go, I will go.&rdquo; Poor girl,
and her home and her garden that she was so proud of!
I feel her garden most of all, because it is a pleasure (I
suppose) that I do not feel myself to share.</p>

<p class="to">To Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The first paragraph of the following refers to the <i>Life of Fleeming
Jenkin</i>; the second, to a remark of his correspondent that a task
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
such as he had proposed to himself in Ireland should be undertaken
by a society rather than an individual.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Skerryvore, Bournemouth, April</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN</span>,&mdash;The Book. It is all drafted:
I hope soon to send you for comments Chapters <span class="sc">III.</span>, <span class="sc">IV.</span>,
and <span class="sc">V.</span> Chapter <span class="sc">VII.</span> is roughly but satisfactorily drafted:
a very little work should put that to rights. But Chapter
<span class="sc">VI.</span> is no joke; it is a <i>mare magnum</i>: I swim and drown
and come up again; and it is all broken ends and mystification:
moreover, I perceive I am in want of more
matter. I must have, first of all, a little letter from
Mr. Ewing about the phonograph work: <i>If</i> you think
he would understand it is quite a matter of chance whether
I use a word or a fact out of it. If you think he would
not: I will go without. Also, could I have a look at
Ewing&rsquo;s <i>prÃ©cis</i>? And lastly, I perceive I must interview
you again about a few points; they are very few, and
might come to little; and I propose to go on getting
things as well together as I can in the meanwhile, and
rather have a final time when all is ready and only to be
criticised. I do still think it will be good. I wonder if
TrÃ©lat would let me cut? But no, I think I wouldn&rsquo;t
after all; &rsquo;tis so quaint and pretty and clever and simple
and French, and gives such a good sight of Fleeming:
the plum of the book, I think.</p>

<p>You misunderstood me in one point: I always hoped
to found such a society; that was the outside of my
dream, and would mean entire success. <i>But</i>&mdash;I cannot
play Peter the Hermit. In these days of the Fleet Street
journalist, I cannot send out better men than myself, with
wives or mothers just as good as mine, and sisters (I may
at least say) better, to a danger and a long-drawn dreariness
that I do not share. My wife says it&rsquo;s cowardice;
what brave men are the leader-writers! Call it cowardice;
it is mine. Mind you, I may end by trying to do it by
the pen only: I shall not love myself if I do; and is it
ever a good thing to do a thing for which you despise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
yourself?&mdash;even in the doing? And if the thing you do
is to call upon others to do the thing you neglect? I have
never dared to say what I feel about men&rsquo;s lives, because
my own was in the wrong: shall I dare to send them to
death? The physician must heal himself; he must
honestly <i>try</i> the path he recommends: if he does not
even try, should he not be silent?</p>

<p>I thank you very heartily for your letter, and for the
seriousness you brought to it. You know, I think when
a serious thing is your own, you keep a saner man by
laughing at it and yourself as you go. So I do not write
possibly with all the really somewhat sickened gravity I
feel. And indeed, what with the book, and this business
to which I referred, and Ireland, I am scarcely in an
enviable state. Well, I ought to be glad, after ten years
of the worst training on earth&mdash;valetudinarianism&mdash;that I
can still be troubled by a duty. You shall hear more in
time; so far, I am at least decided: I will go and see
Balfour when I get to London.</p>

<p>We have all had a great pleasure: a Mrs. Rawlinson
came and brought with her a nineteen-year-old daughter,
simple, human, as beautiful as&mdash;herself; I never admired
a girl before, you know it was my weakness: we are all
three dead in love with her. How nice to be able to do
so much good to harassed people by&mdash;yourself!&mdash;Ever
yours,</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Within a fortnight after the date of the above Stevenson went
himself, and for the last time, to Scotland, and was present, too
late for recognition, at the death of his father (May 8, 1887). Business
detained him for some weeks, and the following was written
just before his return to Bournemouth.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh, June</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR S. C.</span>,&mdash;At last I can write a word to you.
Your little note in the P.M.G. was charming. I have
written four pages in the Contemporary, which Bunting
found room for: they are not very good, but I shall do
more for his memory in time.</p>

<p>About the death, I have long hesitated, I was long
before I could tell my mind; and now I know it, and can
but say that I am glad. If we could have had my father,
that would have been a different thing. But to keep that
changeling&mdash;suffering changeling&mdash;any longer, could better
none and nothing. Now he rests; it is more significant, it
is more like himself. He will begin to return to us in the
course of time, as he was and as we loved him.</p>

<p>My favourite words in literature, my favourite scene&mdash;&ldquo;O
let him pass,&rdquo; Kent and Lear&mdash;was played for me here
in the first moment of my return. I believe Shakespeare
saw it with his own father. I had no words; but it was
shocking to see. He died on his feet, you know; was on
his feet the last day, knowing nobody&mdash;still he would be
up. This was his constant wish; also that he might
smoke a pipe on his last day. The funeral would have
pleased him; it was the largest private funeral in man&rsquo;s
memory here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span></p>

<p>We have no plans, and it is possible we may go home
without going through town. I do not know; I have no
views yet whatever; nor can have any at this stage of
my cold and my business.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SIMPSON</span>,&mdash;This is a long time I have not
acknowledged the Art of Golf, though I read it through
within thirty-six hours of its arrival. I have been ill and
out of heart, and ill again and again ill, till I am weary
of it, and glad indeed to try the pitch-farthing hazard of
a trip to Colorado or New Mexico. There we go, if I prove
fit for the start, on August 20th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Art of Golf. A lot of it is very funny,
and I liked the fun very well; but what interested me
most was the more serious part, because it turns all the
while on a branch of psychology that no one has treated
and that interests me much: the psychology of athletics.
I had every reason to be interested in it, because I am
abnormal: I have no memory in athletics. I have forgotten
how to ride and how to skate; and I should
not be the least surprised if I had forgotten how to
swim.</p>

<p>I find I can write no more: it is the first I have tried

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>During the two months following his father&rsquo;s death Stevenson
had suffered much both from his old complaints and from depression
of mind. His only work had been in preparing for press the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
verse collection <i>Underwoods</i>, the <i>Life of Fleeming Jenkin</i>, and the
volume of essays called <i>Memories and Portraits</i>. The opinions
quoted are those of physicians.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>[Skerryvore, Bournemouth] August</i> 1887.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;I write to inform you that Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s
well-known work, <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>, is about to be
reprinted. At the same time a second volume called
<i>Memories and Portraits</i> will issue from the roaring loom.
Its interest will be largely autobiographical, Mr. S. having
sketched there the lineaments of many departed friends,
and dwelt fondly, and with a m&rsquo;istened eye, upon by-gone
pleasures. The two will be issued under the common
title of <i>Familiar Essays</i>; but the volumes will be vended
separately to those who are mean enough not to hawk
at both.</p>

<p>The blood is at last stopped: only yesterday. I began
to think I should not get away. However, I hope&mdash;I
hope&mdash;remark the word&mdash;no boasting&mdash;I hope I may luff
up a bit now. Dobell, whom I saw, gave as usual a good
account of my lungs, and expressed himself, like his
neighbours, hopefully about the trip. He says, my uncle
says, Scott says, Brown says&mdash;they all say&mdash;You ought
not to be in such a state of health; you should recover.
Well, then, I mean to. My spirits are rising again after
three months of black depression: I almost begin to feel
as if I should care to live: I would, by God! And so I
believe I shall.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES AGAIN</h3>

<h3>WINTER IN THE ADIRONDACKS</h3>

<h5><span class="sc">August 1887&mdash;June 1888</span></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> letters printed in the following section are selected
from those which tell of Stevenson&rsquo;s voyage to New York
and reception there at the beginning of September 1887;
of his winter&rsquo;s life and work at Saranac Lake, and of
his decision taken in May 1888 to venture on a yachting
cruise in the South Seas.</p>

<p>The moment of his arrival at New York was that when
his reputation had first reached its height in the United
States, owing to the popularity both of <i>Treasure Island</i>
and <i>Kidnapped</i>, but more especially to the immense
impression made by the <i>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde</i>. He experienced consequently for the first time
the pleasures, such as they were, of celebrity, and also its
inconveniences; found the most hospitable of refuges in
the house of his kind friends, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Fairchild,
at Newport; and quickly made many other friends,
including the late Augustus St. Gaudens, the famous
sculptor, with Mr. C. Scribner and Mr. E. L. Burlingame,
the owner and the editor of Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine, from
whom he immediately received and accepted very advantageous
offers of work. Having been dissuaded from
braving for the present the fatigue of the long journey to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
Colorado and the extreme rigour of its winter climate, he
determined to try instead a season at Saranac Lake in the
Adirondack Mountains, New York State, which had lately
been coming into reputation as a place of cure. There,
under the care of the well-known resident physician, Dr.
Trudeau, he spent nearly seven months, from the end of
September 1887 to the end of April 1888, with results
on the whole favourable to his own health, though not
to that of his wife, which could never support these winter
mountain cures. On the 16th of April, he and his party
left Saranac. After spending a fortnight in New York,
where, as always in cities, his health quickly flagged
again, he went for the month of May into seaside quarters
at Union House, Manasquan, on the New Jersey coast,
for the sake of fresh air and boating. Here he enjoyed
the occasional society of some of his New York friends,
including Mr. St. Gaudens and Mr. W. H. Low, and was
initiated in the congenial craft of cat-boat sailing. In the
meantime, Mrs. Stevenson had gone to San Francisco to
see her relatives; and holding that the climate of the
Pacific was likely to be better for the projected cruise than
that of the Atlantic, had inquired there whether a yacht
was to be hired for such a purpose. The schooner <i>Casco</i>,
Captain Otis, was found. Stevenson signified by telegraph
his assent to the arrangement; determined to risk
in the adventure the sum of Â£2000, of which his father&rsquo;s
death had put him in possession, hoping to recoup himself
by a series of Letters recounting his experiences, for
which he had received a commission from Mr. S. S. M&rsquo;Clure;
and on the 2nd of June started with his mother and stepson
for San Francisco, the first stage on that island cruise
from which he was destined never to return.</p>

<p>His work during the season September 1887-May 1888
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
had consisted of the twelve papers published in the course
of 1888 in Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine, including perhaps the most
striking of all his essays, <i>A Chapter on Dreams</i>, <i>Pulvis et
Umbra</i>, <i>Beggars</i>, <i>The Lantern Bearers</i>, <i>Random Memories</i>,
etc.; as well as the greater part of the <i>Master of Ballantrae</i>
and <i>The Wrong Box</i>&mdash;the last originally conceived and
drafted by Mr. Lloyd Osbourne.</p>


<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>A succession of Stevenson&rsquo;s friends had visited and spent part
of the day or the evening with him at Armfield&rsquo;s hotel on Sunday,
August 20th, each bringing some farewell gift or another (as related
by Mr. Gosse in his volume <i>Critical Kitcats</i>, p. 297). Among these,
Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s gift had been a case of champagne for consumption
during the journey. On the morning of the 21st I accompanied
him to the docks, saw him and his party embarked on board
the steamer <i>Ludgate Hill</i>, a vessel sailing from the port of London
and carrying animals and freight as well as passengers. They had
chosen to go by this route for the sake alike of economy and amusement,
rather than by one of the sumptuous liners sailing from
Liverpool or Southampton. Leaving the ship&rsquo;s side as she weighed
anchor, and waving farewell to the party from the boat which
landed me, I little knew what was the truth, that I was looking on
the face of my friend for the last time. The letters next following
were written during or Immediately after his passage across the
Atlantic. &ldquo;The Commodore&rdquo; is of course R. L. S.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>H.M.S.</i> Vulgarium, <i>off Havre de Grace,<br />
this 22nd day of August</i> [1887].</p>

<p><span class="scs">SIR</span>,&mdash;The weather has been hitherto inimitable. Inimitable
is the only word that I can apply to our fellow-voyagers,
whom a categorist, possibly premature, has been
already led to divide into two classes&mdash;the better sort
consisting of the baser kind of Bagman, and the worser
of undisguised Beasts of the Field. The berths are excellent,
the pasture swallowable, the champagne of H. James
(to recur to my favourite adjective) inimitable. As for
the Commodore, he slept awhile in the evening, tossed off
a cup of Henry James with his plain meal, walked the deck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
till eight, among sands and floating lights and buoys and
wrecked brigantines, came down (to his regret) a minute
too soon to see Margate lit up, turned in about nine, slept,
with some interruptions, but on the whole sweetly, until
six, and has already walked a mile or so of deck, among
a fleet of other steamers waiting for the tide, within view
of Havre, and pleasantly entertained by passing fishing-boats,
hovering sea-gulls, and Vulgarians pairing on deck
with endearments of primitive simplicity. There, sir, can
be viewed the sham quarrel, the sham desire for information,
and every device of these two poor ancient sexes (who
might, you might think, have learned in the course of the
ages something new) down to the exchange of head-gear.&mdash;I
am, sir, yours,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Bold Bob Boltsprit.</p>

<p class="pt2">B. B. B. (<i>alias</i> the Commodore) will now turn to his
proofs. Havre de Grace is a city of some show. It is
for-ti-fied; and, so far as I can see, is a place of some
trade. It is situ-ated in France, a country of Europe.
You always complain there are no facts in my letters.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Newport, R.I., U.S.A.</i> [<i>September</i> 1887]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;So long it went excellent well, and
I had a time I am glad to have had; really enjoying my
life. There is nothing like being at sea, after all. And
O, why have I allowed myself to rot so long on land?
But on the Banks I caught a cold, and I have not yet got
over it. My reception here was idiotic to the last degree....
It is very silly, and not pleasant, except where
humour enters; and I confess the poor interviewer lads
pleased me. They are too good for their trade; avoided
anything I asked them to avoid, and were no more vulgar
in their reports than they could help. I liked the lads.</p>

<p>O, it was lovely on our stable-ship, chock full of stallions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
She rolled heartily, rolled some of the fittings out of our
state-room, and I think a more dangerous cruise (except
that it was summer) it would be hard to imagine. But
we enjoyed it to the masthead, all but Fanny; and even
she perhaps a little. When we got in, we had run out of
beer, stout, cocoa, soda-water, water, fresh meat, and
(almost) of biscuit. But it was a thousandfold pleasanter
than a great big Birmingham liner like a new hotel; and
we liked the officers, and made friends with the quarter-masters,
and I (at least) made a friend of a baboon (for
we carried a cargo of apes), whose embraces have pretty
near cost me a coat. The passengers improved, and were
a very good specimen lot, with no drunkard, no gambling
that I saw, and less grumbling and backbiting than one
would have asked of poor human nature. Apes, stallions,
cows, matches, hay, and poor men-folk, all, or almost all,
came successfully to land.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Newport, U.S.A., September</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR JAMES</span>,&mdash;Here we are at Newport in the house
of the good Fairchilds; and a sad burthen we have laid
upon their shoulders. I have been in bed practically ever
since I came. I caught a cold on the Banks after having
had the finest time conceivable, and enjoyed myself more
than I could have hoped on board our strange floating
menagerie: stallions and monkeys and matches made our
cargo; and the vast continent of these incongruities rolled
the while like a haystack; and the stallions stood hypnotised
by the motion, looking through the ports at our
dinner-table, and winked when the crockery was broken;
and the little monkeys stared at each other in their cages,
and were thrown overboard like little bluish babies; and
the big monkey, Jacko, scoured about the ship and rested
willingly in my arms, to the ruin of my clothing; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
man of the stallions made a bower of the black tarpaulin,
and sat therein at the feet of a raddled divinity, like a
picture on a box of chocolates; and the other passengers,
when they were not sick, looked on and laughed. Take
all this picture, and make it roll till the bell shall sound
unexpected notes and the fittings shall break loose in our
state-room, and you have the voyage of the <i>Ludgate Hill</i>.
She arrived in the port of New York, without beer, porter,
soda-water, curaÃ§oa, fresh meat, or fresh water; and yet
we lived, and we regret her.</p>

<p>My wife is a good deal run down, and I am no great
shakes.</p>

<p>America is, as I remarked, a fine place to eat in, and
a great place for kindness; but, Lord, what a silly thing
is popularity! I envy the cool obscurity of Skerryvore.
If it even paid, said Meanness! and was abashed at himself.&mdash;Yours
most sincerely,</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>New York, end of September</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR S. C.</span>,&mdash;Your delightful letter has just come,
and finds me in a New York hotel, waiting the arrival
of a sculptor (St. Gaudens) who is making a medallion of
yours truly and who is (to boot) one of the handsomest
and nicest fellows I have seen. I caught a cold on the
Banks; fog is not for me; nearly died of interviewers and
visitors, during twenty-four hours in New York; cut for
Newport with Lloyd and Valentine, a journey like fairyland
for the most engaging beauties, one little rocky and
pine-shaded cove after another, each with a house and a
boat at anchor, so that I left my heart in each and marvelled
why American authors had been so unjust to their
country; caught another cold on the train; arrived at
Newport to go to bed and to grow worse, and to stay in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
bed until I left again; the Fairchilds proving during this
time kindness itself; Mr. Fairchild simply one of the
most engaging men in the world, and one of the children,
Blair, <i>aet.</i> ten, a great joy and amusement in his solemn
adoring attitude to the author of <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>

<p>Here I was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptor.&mdash;I
withdraw calling him handsome; he is not quite that, his
eyes are too near together; he is only remarkable looking,
and like an Italian cinque-cento medallion; I have begged
him to make a medallion of himself and give me a copy.
I will not take up the sentence in which I was wandering
so long, but begin fresh. I was ten or twelve days at
Newport; then came back convalescent to New York.
Fanny and Lloyd are off to the Adirondacks to see if that
will suit; and the rest of us leave Monday (this is Saturday)
to follow them up. I hope we may manage to stay
there all winter. I have a splendid appetite and have on
the whole recovered well after a mighty sharp attack.
I am now on a salary of Â£500 a year for twelve articles
in Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine on what I like; it is more than
Â£500, but I cannot calculate more precisely. You have
no idea how much is made of me here; I was offered
Â£2000 for a weekly article&mdash;eh heh! how is that? but I
refused that lucrative job. The success of <i>Underwoods</i> is
gratifying. You see, the verses are sane; that is their strong
point, and it seems it is strong enough to carry them.</p>

<p>A thousand thanks for your grand letter.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac Lake, Adirondacks,
New York, U.S.A.</i> [<i>October</i> 1887].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BOB</span>,&mdash;The cold [of Colorado] was too rigorous
for me; I could not risk the long railway voyage, and the
season was too late to risk the Eastern, Cape Hatteras
side of the steamer one; so here we stuck and stick. We
have a wooden house on a hill-top, overlooking a river,
and a village about a quarter of a mile away, and very
wooded hills; the whole scene is very Highland, bar want
of heather and the wooden houses.</p>

<p>I have got one good thing of my sea voyage: it is
proved the sea agrees heartily with me, and my mother
likes it; so if I get any better, or no worse, my mother
will likely hire a yacht for a month or so in summer. Good
Lord! What fun! Wealth is only useful for two things:
a yacht and a string quartette. For these two I will sell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
my soul. Except for these I hold that Â£700 a year is as
much as any body can possibly want; and I have had
more, so I know, for the extry coins were for no use, excepting
for illness, which damns everything.</p>

<p>I was so happy on board that ship, I could not have
believed it possible. We had the beastliest weather, and
many discomforts; but the mere fact of its being a tramp-ship
gave us many comforts; we could cut about with the
men and officers, stay in the wheel-house, discuss all
manner of things, and really be a little at sea. And truly
there is nothing else. I had literally forgotten what happiness
was, and the full mind&mdash;full of external and physical
things, not full of cares and labours and rot about a fellow&rsquo;s
behaviour. My heart literally sang; I truly care for
nothing so much as for that. We took so north a course,
that we saw Newfoundland; no one in the ship had ever
seen it before.</p>

<p>It was beyond belief to me how she rolled; in seemingly
smooth water, the bell striking, the fittings bounding
out of our state-room. It is worth having lived these
last years, partly because I have written some better
books, which is always pleasant, but chiefly to have had
the joy of this voyage. I have been made a lot of here,
and it is sometimes pleasant, sometimes the reverse; but
I could give it all up, and agree that &mdash;&mdash; was the author
of my works, for a good seventy ton schooner and the
coins to keep her on. And to think there are parties with
yachts who would make the exchange! I know a little
about fame now; it is no good compared to a yacht; and
anyway there is more fame in a yacht, more genuine
fame; to cross the Atlantic and come to anchor in Newport
(say) with the Union Jack, and go ashore for your
letters and hang about the pier, among the holiday yachtsmen&mdash;that&rsquo;s
fame, that&rsquo;s glory, and nobody can take it
away; they can&rsquo;t say your book is bad; you <i>have</i> crossed
the Atlantic. I should do it south by the West Indies,
to avoid the damned Banks; and probably come home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
by steamer, and leave the skipper to bring the yacht
home.</p>

<p>Well, if all goes well, we shall maybe sail out of Southampton
water some of these days and take a run to Havre,
and try the Baltic, or somewhere.</p>

But the place of our abode is Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks;
it is a mighty good place too, and I mean it shall
do me good. Indeed the dreadful depression and collapse
of last summer has quite passed away; it was a thorough
change I wanted; I wonder perhaps if it wouldn&rsquo;t pick
you up&mdash;if you are not picked up already; you have been
a long time in Great Britain; and that is a slow poison,
very slow for the strong, but certain for all. Old Dr.
Chepmell told Lloyd: any one can stay a year in England
and be the better for it, but no one can stay there steadily
and not be the worse.</p>

<p>I have had a very curious experience here; being very
much made of, and called upon, and all that; quite the
famous party in fact: it is not so nice as people try to
make out, when you are young, and don&rsquo;t want to bother
working. Fame is nothing to a yacht; <i>experto crede</i>.
There are nice bits of course; for you meet very pleasant

and a fraud; and I am much happier up here, where I
see no one and live my own life. One thing is they do
not stick for money to the Famed One; I was offered
Â£2000 a year for a weekly article; and I accepted (and
now enjoy) Â£720 a year for a monthly one: 720/12 (whatever
that may be) for each article, as long or as short as I please,
and on any mortal subject. I am sure it will do me harm to
do it; but the sum was irresistible. See calculations on verso

<div class="quote">
<p>The following refers to a review by Mr. Gosse of Stevenson&rsquo;s
volume of verse called <i>Underwoods</i>. The book had been published
a few weeks previously, and is dedicated, as readers will remember,
to a number of physicians who had attended him at sundry times
and places.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac Lake, Oct. 8th,</i> 1887.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;I have just read your article twice,
with cheers of approving laughter. I do not believe you
ever wrote anything so funny: Tyndall&rsquo;s &ldquo;shell,&rdquo; the
passage on the Davos press and its invaluable issues, and
that on V. Hugo and Swinburne, are exquisite; so, I say
it more ruefully, is the touch about the doctors. For the
rest, I am very glad you like my verses so well; and the
qualities you ascribe to them seem to me well found and
well named. I own to that kind of candour you attribute
to me: when I am frankly interested, I suppose I fancy
the public will be so too; and when I am moved, I am
sure of it. It has been my luck hitherto to meet with no
staggering disillusion. &ldquo;Before&rdquo; and &ldquo;After&rdquo; may be
two; and yet I believe the habit is now too thoroughly
ingrained to be altered. About the doctors, you were
right, that dedication has been the subject of some pleasantries
that made me grind, and of your happily touched
reproof which made me blush. And to miscarry in a
dedication is an abominable form of book-wreck; I am
a good captain, I would rather lose the tent and save my
dedication.</p>

<p>I am at Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks, I suppose
for the winter: it seems a first-rate place; we have a
house in the eye of many winds, with a view of a piece of
running water&mdash;Highland, all but the dear hue of peat&mdash;and
of many hills&mdash;Highland also, but for the lack of
heather. Soon the snow will close on us; we are here
some twenty miles&mdash;twenty-seven, they say, but this I
profoundly disbelieve&mdash;in the woods: communication by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
letter is slow and (let me be consistent) aleatory; by
telegram is as near as may be possible.</p>

<p>I had some experience of American appreciation; I
liked a little of it, but there is too much; a little of that
would go a long way to spoil a man; and I like myself
better in the woods. I am so damned candid and ingenuous
(for a cynic), and so much of a &ldquo;cweatu&rsquo; of impulse&mdash;aw&rdquo;
(if you remember that admirable Leech) that I begin
to shirk any more taffy; I think I begin to like it too
well. But let us trust the Gods; they have a rod in pickle;
reverently I doff my trousers, and with screwed eyes await
the <i>amari aliquid</i> of the great God Busby.</p>

bien senties</i>. We are here at a first-rate place. &ldquo;Baker&rsquo;s&rdquo;
is the name of our house, but we don&rsquo;t address there; we
prefer the tender care of the Post-Office, as more aristocratic
(it is no use to telegraph even to the care of the
Post-Office, who does not give a single damn<a name="FnAnchor_22" id="FnAnchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>). Baker&rsquo;s
has a prophet&rsquo;s chamber, which the hypercritical might
describe as a garret with a hole in the floor: in that garret,
sir, I have to trouble you and your wife to come and
slumber. Not now, however: with manly hospitality, I
choke off any sudden impulse. Because first, my wife
and my mother are gone (a note for the latter, strongly
suspected to be in the hand of your talented wife, now
sits silent on the mantel shelf), one to Niagara and t&rsquo;other
to Indianapolis. Because, second, we are not yet installed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
And because, third, I won&rsquo;t have you till I have a buffalo
robe and leggings, lest you should want to paint me as a
plain man, which I am not, but a rank Saranacker and
wild man of the woods.&mdash;Yours,</p>

where hardy visitors can sleep, and our table (if homely)
is not bad.</p>

<p>And here, appropriately enough, comes in the begging

<p><span class="scs">DEAR ARCHER</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for the Wondrous Tale.
It is scarcely a work of genius, as I believe you felt. Thanks
also for your pencillings; though I defend &ldquo;shrew,&rdquo; or
at least many of the shrews.</p>

<p>We are here (I suppose) for the winter in the Adirondacks,
a hill and forest country on the Canadian border
of New York State, very unsettled and primitive and cold,
and healthful, or we are the more bitterly deceived. I
believe it will do well for me; but must not boast.</p>

<p>My wife is away to Indiana to see her family; my
mother, Lloyd, and I remain here in the cold, which has
been exceeding sharp, and the hill air, which is inimitably
fine. We all eat bravely, and sleep well, and make great
fires, and get along like one o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>I am now a salaried party; I am a <i>bourgeois</i> now; I
am to write a weekly paper for Scribner&rsquo;s, at a scale of
payment which makes my teeth ache for shame and
diffidence. The editor is, I believe, to apply to you; for
we were talking over likely men, and when I instanced
you, he said he had had his eye upon you from the first.
It is worth while, perhaps, to get in tow with the Scribners;
they are such thorough gentlefolk in all ways that it is
always a pleasure to deal with them. I am like to be a
millionaire if this goes on, and be publicly hanged at the
social revolution: well, I would prefer that to dying in

my bed; and it would be a godsend to my biographer, if
ever I have one. What are you about? I hope you are
all well and in good case and spirits, as I am now, after
a most nefast experience of despondency before I left; but
indeed I was quite run down. Remember me to Mrs.

at Montreal.</p>

<p>My news is not much, my mother is away to Niagara
and Fanny to Indiana; the Port Admiral and I and
Valentine keep house together in our verandahed cottage
near a wood. I am writing, and have got into the vein.
When I got to N. Y. a paper offered me Â£2000 a year to
do critical weekly articles for them; the sum was so enormous
that I tottered; however, Scribner at once offered
me the same scale to give him a monthly paper in his
magazine; indeed it is rather higher, Â£720 for the twelve
papers. This I could not decently refuse; and I am now
a yoked man, and after a fit of my usual impotence under
bondage, seem to have got into the swing. I suppose I
shall scarce manage to do much else; but there is the
fixed sum, which shines like a sun in the firmament. A
prophet has certainly a devil of a lot of honour (and much
coins) in another country, whatever he has in his own.</p>

<p>I got Gleeson White; your best work and either the best
or second best in the book is the Ballade in Hot Weather;
that is really a masterpiece of melody and fancy. Damn
your Villanelles&mdash;and everybody&rsquo;s. G. Macdonald comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
out strong in his two pious rondels; <i>Fons BandusiÃ¦</i>
seems as exquisite as ever. To my surprise, I liked two
of the Pantoums, the blue-bottle, and the still better
after-death one from <i>Love in Idleness</i>. Lang cuts a poor
figure, except in the Cricket one; your patter ballade is
a great <i>tour de force</i>, but spoiled by similar cÃ¦suras. On
the whole &rsquo;tis a ridiculous volume, and I had more pleasure
out of it than I expected. I forgot to praise Grant Allen&rsquo;s
excellent ballade, which is the one that runs with yours,&mdash;and
here, to the point, a note from you at Margate&mdash;among
East Winds and Plain Women, damn them! Well,
what can we do or say? We are only at Saranac for the
winter; and if this <i>Deacon</i> comes off, why you may join
us there in glory; I would I had some news of it. Saranac
is not <i>quite</i> so dear, in some ways, as the rest of this land,
where it costs you a pound to sneeze, and fifty to blow
your nose; but even here it costs $2Â·50 to get a box from
the station! Think of it! Lift it up tenderly! They
had need to pay well! but how poor devils live; and how
it can pay to take a theatre company over to such a land,
is more than I can fancy. The devil of the States for
you is the conveyances, they are so dear&mdash;but O, what
is not!</p>

<p>I have thrown off my cold in excellent style, though
still very groggy about the knees, so that when I climb
a paling, of which we have many, I feel as precarious
and nutatory as a man of ninety. Under this I grind;
but I believe the place will suit me. Must stop.&mdash;Ever

the well-known American artist, who had been a welcome visitor to
Stevenson at Bournemouth, and had drawn his portrait there. The
humorous romance proceeding from Mr. Osbourne&rsquo;s typewriter was
the first draft of <i>The Wrong Box</i>; or, as it was originally called, <i>The
Finsbury Tontine</i>, or <i>The Game of Bluff</i>. The article by Mr. Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
James referred to in the last paragraph is one on R. L. S. which
had appeared in the Century Magazine for October, and was reprinted
in <i>Partial Portraits</i>.</p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: right;">[<i>Saranac Lake, October</i> 1887.] I know not the day; but<br />
                                     the month it is the
                                     drear October by<br />
                                     the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENRY JAMES</span>,&mdash;This is to say <i>First</i>, the
voyage was a huge success. We all enjoyed it (bar my
wife) to the ground: sixteen days at sea with a cargo of
hay, matches, stallions, and monkeys, and in a ship with
no style on, and plenty of sailors to talk to, and the endless
pleasures of the sea&mdash;the romance of it, the sport of the
scratch dinner and the smashing crockery, the pleasure&mdash;an
endless pleasure&mdash;of balancing to the swell: well, it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, I had a fine time, rather a troubled one, at Newport
and New York; saw much of and liked hugely the
Fairchilds, St. Gaudens the sculptor, Gilder of the Century&mdash;just
saw the dear Alexander&mdash;saw a lot of my old and
admirable friend Will Low, whom I wish you knew and
appreciated&mdash;was medallioned by St. Gaudens, and at
last escaped to</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Saranac Lake, where we now are, and which I
believe we mean to like and pass the winter at. Our
house&mdash;emphatically &ldquo;Baker&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;is on a hill, and has a
sight of a stream turning a corner in the valley&mdash;bless the
face of running water!&mdash;and sees some hills too, and the
paganly prosaic roofs of Saranac itself; the Lake it does
not see, nor do I regret that; I like water (fresh water I
mean) either running swiftly among stones, or else largely
qualified with whisky. As I write, the sun (which has
been long a stranger) shines in at my shoulder; from the
next room, the bell of Lloyd&rsquo;s typewriter makes an agreeable
music as it patters off (at a rate which astonishes this
experienced novelist) the early chapters of a humorous
romance; from still further off&mdash;the walls of Baker&rsquo;s are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
neither ancient nor massive&mdash;rumours of Valentine about
the kitchen stove come to my ears; of my mother and
Fanny I hear nothing, for the excellent reason that they
have gone sparking off, one to Niagara, one to Indianapolis.
People complain that I never give news in my letters. I
have wiped out that reproach.</p>

<p>But now, <i>Fourth</i>, I have seen the article; and it may
be from natural partiality, I think it the best you have
written. O&mdash;I remember the Gautier, which was an
excellent performance; and the Balzac, which was good;
and the Daudet, over which I licked my chops; but the
R. L. S. is better yet. It is so humorous, and it hits my
little frailties with so neat (and so friendly) a touch; and
Alan is the occasion for so much happy talk, and the
quarrel is so generously praised. I read it twice, though
it was only some hours in my possession; and Low, who
got it for me from the Century, sat up to finish it ere he
returned it; and, sir, we were all delighted. Here is the
paper out, nor will anything, not even friendship, not even
gratitude for the article, induce me to begin a second
sheet; so here, with the kindest remembrances and the
warmest good wishes, I remain, yours affectionately,</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Shortly after the date of the present correspondence Stevenson,
to his great advantage, put all his publishing arrangements (as he
had already put his private business) into the hands of his friend
Mr. Baxter. Meantime he was managing them himself; and an
occasional lapse of memory or attention betrayed him once or twice
into misunderstandings, and once at least conflicting agreements
with two different publishers, both his friends. He was the first to
denounce the error when he became aware of it, and suffered sharply
from the sense of his own unintentional fault. The next two letters,
and some allusions in those which follow, relate to this affair.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, November 20 or 21,</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MR. SCRIBNER</span>,&mdash;Heaven help me, I am under
a curse just now. I have played fast and loose with what
I said to you; and that, I beg you to believe, in the purest
innocence of mind. I told you you should have the power
over all my work in this country; and about a fortnight
ago, when M&rsquo;Clure was here, I calmly signed a bargain for
the serial publication of a story. You will scarce believe
that I did this in mere oblivion; but I did; and all that
I can say is that I will do so no more, and ask you to
forgive me. Please write to me soon as to this.</p>

<p>Will you oblige me by paying in for three articles, as
already sent, to my account with John Paton &amp; Co., 52
William Street? This will be most convenient for us.</p>

<p>The fourth article is nearly done; and I am the more
deceived, or it is <i>A Buster</i>.</p>

<p>Now as to the first thing in this letter, I do wish to
hear from you soon; and I am prepared to hear any reproach,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
or (what is harder to hear) any forgiveness; for I
have deserved the worst.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To E. L. Burlingame</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This is the first of many letters, increasing in friendliness as the
correspondence goes on, to the editor of Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, November</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;I enclose corrected proof of
<i>Beggars</i>, which seems good. I mean to make a second
sermon, which, if it is about the same length as <i>Pulvis et
Umbra</i>, might go in along with it as two sermons, in which
case I should call the first &ldquo;The Whole Creation,&rdquo; and the
second &ldquo;Any Good.&rdquo; We shall see; but you might say
how you like the notion.</p>

<p>One word: if you have heard from Mr. Scribner of
my unhappy oversight in the matter of a story, you will
make me ashamed to write to you, and yet I wish to beg
you to help me into quieter waters. The oversight committed&mdash;and
I do think it was not so bad as Mr. Scribner
seems to think it&mdash;and discovered, I was in a miserable
position. I need not tell you that my first impulse was to
offer to share or to surrender the price agreed upon when
it should fall due; and it is almost to my credit that
I arranged to refrain. It is one of these positions from
which there is no escape; I cannot undo what I have done.
And I wish to beg you&mdash;should Mr. Scribner speak to you
in the matter&mdash;to try to get him to see this neglect of mine
for no worse than it is: unpardonable enough, because
a breach of an agreement; but still pardonable, because a
piece of sheer carelessness and want of memory, done, God
knows, without design and since most sincerely regretted.
I have no memory. You have seen how I omitted to
reserve the American rights in <i>Jekyll</i>: last winter I wrote
and demanded, as an increase, a less sum than had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
been agreed upon for a story that I gave to Cassell&rsquo;s.
For once that my forgetfulness has, by a cursed fortune,
seemed to gain, instead of lose, me money, it is painful
indeed that I should produce so poor an impression on the
mind of Mr. Scribner. But I beg you to believe, and if
possible to make him believe, that I am in no degree or
sense a <i>faiseur</i>, and that in matters of business my design,
at least, is honest. Nor (bating bad memory and self-deception)
am I untruthful in such affairs.</p>

<p>If Mr. Scribner shall have said nothing to you in the
matter, please regard the above as unwritten, and believe
me, yours very truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To E. L. Burlingame</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, November</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;The revise seemed all right,
so I did not trouble you with it; indeed, my demand for
one was theatrical, to impress that obdurate dog, your
reader. Herewith a third paper: it has been a cruel long
time upon the road, but here it is, and not bad at last, I
fondly hope. I was glad you liked the <i>Lantern Bearers</i>;
I did, too. I thought it was a good paper, really contained
some excellent sense, and was ingeniously put together.
I have not often had more trouble than I have with these
papers; thirty or forty pages of foul copy, twenty is the
very least I have had. Well, you pay high; it is fit that
I should have to work hard, it somewhat quiets my conscience.&mdash;Yours
very truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To John Addington Symonds</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac Lake, Adirondack Mountains,<br />
New York, U.S.A., November</i> 21, 1887.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SYMONDS</span>,&mdash;I think we have both meant and
wanted to write to you any time these months; but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
have been much tossed about, among new faces and old,
and new scenes and old, and scenes (like this of Saranac)
which are neither one nor other. To give you some clue
to our affairs, I had best begin pretty well back. We
sailed from the Thames in a vast bucket of iron that took
seventeen days from shore to shore. I cannot describe
how I enjoyed the voyage, nor what good it did me; but
on the Banks I caught friend catarrh. In New York and
then in Newport I was pretty ill; but on my return to
New York, lying in bed most of the time, with St. Gaudens
the sculptor sculping me, and my old friend Low around,
I began to pick up once more. Now here we are in a kind
of wilderness of hills and firwoods and boulders and snow
and wooden houses. So far as we have gone the climate
is grey and harsh, but hungry and somnolent; and although
not charming like that of Davos, essentially bracing and
briskening. The country is a kind of insane mixture of
Scotland and a touch of Switzerland and a dash of America,
and a thought of the British Channel in the skies. We have
a decent house&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>December 6th.</i>&mdash;A decent house, as I was saying, sir,
on a hill-top, with a look down a Scottish river in front,
and on one hand a Perthshire hill; on the other, the
beginnings and skirts of the village play hide and seek
among other hills. We have been below zero, I know not
how far (-10 at 8 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> once), and when it is cold it is delightful;
but hitherto the cold has not held, and we have
chopped in and out from frost to thaw, from snow to rain,
from quiet air to the most disastrous north-westerly curdlers
of the blood. After a week of practical thaw, the ice still
bears in favoured places. So there is hope.</p>

<p>I wonder if you saw my book of verses? It went into
a second edition, because of my name, I suppose, and its
<i>prose</i> merits. I do not set up to be a poet. Only an
all-round literary man: a man who talks, not one who
sings. But I believe the very fact that it was only speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
served the book with the public. Horace is much a
speaker, and see how popular! Most of Martial is only
speech, and I cannot conceive a person who does not love
his Martial; most of Burns, also, such as &ldquo;The Louse,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Toothache,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Haggis,&rdquo; and lots more of his
best. Excuse this little apology for my house; but I
don&rsquo;t like to come before people who have a note
of song, and let it be supposed I do not know the
difference.</p>

<p>To return to the more important&mdash;news. My wife
again suffers in high and cold places; I again profit. She
is off to-day to New York for a change, as heretofore to
Berne, but I am glad to say in better case than then. Still
it is undeniable she suffers, and you must excuse her (at
least) if we both prove bad correspondents. I am decidedly
better, but I have been terribly cut up with business complications:
one disagreeable, as threatening loss; one, of
the most intolerable complexion, as involving me in dishonour.
The burthen of consistent carelessness: I have
lost much by it in the past; and for once (to my damnation)
I have gained. I am sure you will sympathise. It is hard
work to sleep; it is hard to be told you are a liar, and have
to hold your peace, and think, &ldquo;Yes, by God, and a thief
too!&rdquo; You remember my lectures on Ajax, or the Unintentional
Sin? Well, I know all about that now. Nothing
seems so unjust to the sufferer: or is more just in essence.
<i>Laissez passer la justice de Dieu.</i></p>

<p>Lloyd has learned to use the typewriter, and has most
gallantly completed upon that the draft of a tale, which
seems to me not without merit and promise, it is so silly,
so gay, so absurd, in spots (to my partial eyes) so genuinely
humorous. It is true, he would not have written it but
for the <i>New Arabian Nights</i>; but it is strange to find a
young writer funny. Heavens, but I was depressing when
I took the pen in hand! And now I doubt if I am sadder
than my neighbours. Will this beginner move in the
inverse direction?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span></p>

<p>Let me have your news, and believe me, my dear
Symonds, with genuine affection, yours,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following refers to a volume on the elder Dumas, which
Mr. Henley was at this time preparing to write, and which he proposed
to dedicate to his friend.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac</i> [<i>December</i> 1887].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LAD</span>,&mdash;I was indeed overjoyed to hear of the
Dumas. In the matter of the dedication, are not cross
dedications a little awkward? Lang and Rider Haggard
did it, to be sure. Perpend. And if you should conclude
against a dedication, there is a passage in <i>Memories and
Portraits</i> written <i>at</i> you, when I was most desperate (to
stir you up a bit), which might be quoted: something
about Dumas still waiting his biographer. I have a decent
time when the weather is fine; when it is grey, or windy
or wet (as it too often is), I am merely degraded to the
dirt. I get some work done every day with a devil of a
heave; not extra good ever; and I regret my engagement.
Whiles I have had the most deplorable business
annoyances too; have been threatened with having to
refund money; got over that; and found myself in the
worst scrape of being a kind of unintentional swindler.
These have worried me a great deal; also old age with his
stealing steps seems to have clawed me in his clutch to
some tune.</p>

<p>Do you play All Fours? We are trying it; it is still
all haze to me. Can the elder hand <i>beg</i> more than once?
The Port Admiral is at Boston mingling with millionaires.
I am but a weed on Lethe wharf. The wife is only so-so.
The Lord lead us all: if I can only get off the stage with
clean hands, I shall sing Hosanna. &ldquo;Put&rdquo; is described
quite differently from your version in a book I have; what
are your rules? The Port Admiral is using a game of Put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
in a tale of his, the first copy of which was gloriously
finished about a fortnight ago, and the revise gallantly
begun: <i>The Finsbury Tontine</i> it is named, and might fill
two volumes, and is quite incredibly silly, and in parts (it
seems to me) pretty humorous.&mdash;Love to all from</p>

<p class="sc rt">An Old, Old Man.</p>

<p class="pt1">I say, <i>Taine&rsquo;s Origines de la France Contemporaine</i> is
no end; it would turn the dead body of Charles Fox into
a living Tory.</p>


<p class="to">To Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, December</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN</span>,&mdash;The Opal is very well; it is
fed with glycerine when it seems hungry. I am very well,
and get about much more than I could have hoped. My
wife is not very well; there is no doubt the high level does
not agree with her, and she is on the move for a holiday to
New York. Lloyd is at Boston on a visit, and I hope has
a good time. My mother is really first-rate; she and I,
despairing of other games for two, now play All Fours
out of a gamebook, and have not yet discovered its niceties,
if any.</p>

<p>You will have heard, I dare say, that they made a great
row over me here. They also offered me much money, a
great deal more than my works are worth: I took some
of it, and was greedy and hasty, and am now very sorry.
I have done with big prices from now out. Wealth and
self-respect seem, in my case, to be strangers.</p>

<p>We were talking the other day of how well Fleeming
managed to grow rich. Ah, that is a rare art; something
more intellectual than a virtue. The book has not yet
made its appearance here; the Life alone, with a little
preface, is to appear in the States; and the Scribners are
to send you half the royalties. I should like it to do well,
for Fleeming&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span></p>

<p>Will you please send me the Greek water-carrier&rsquo;s
song? I have a particular use for it.</p>

<p>Have I any more news, I wonder?&mdash;and echo wonders
along with me. I am strangely disquieted on all political
matters; and I do not know if it is &ldquo;the signs of the
times&rdquo; or the sign of my own time of life. But to me
the sky seems black both in France and England, and
only partly clear in America. I have not seen it so dark
in my time; of that I am sure.</p>

<p>Please let us have some news; and excuse me, for the
sake of my well-known idleness; and pardon Fanny, who
is really not very well, for this long silence.&mdash;Very sincerely
your friend,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Miss Adelaide Boodle</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The lady at Bournemouth (the giver of the paper-knife) to whom
the following letter is addressed had been trusted to keep an eye
on Stevenson&rsquo;s interests in connection with his house (which had
been let) and other matters, and to report thereon from time to time.
In their correspondence Stevenson is generally referred to as the
Squire and the lady as the Gamekeeper.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, December</i> 1887.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS BOODLE</span>,&mdash;I am so much afraid our gamekeeper
may weary of unacknowledged reports! Hence, in
the midst of a perfect horror of detestable weathers of a quite
incongruous strain, and with less desire for correspondence
than&mdash;well, than&mdash;well, with no desire for correspondence,
behold me dash into the breach. Do keep up
your letters. They are most delightful to this exiled backwoods
family; and in your next, we shall hope somehow
or other to hear better news of you and yours&mdash;that in the
first place&mdash;and to hear more news of our beasts and birds
and kindly fruits of earth and those human tenants who
are (truly) too much with us.</p>

<p>I am very well; better than for years: that is for good.
But then my wife is no great shakes; the place does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
suit her&mdash;it is my private opinion that no place does&mdash;and
she is now away down to New York for a change,
which (as Lloyd is in Boston) leaves my mother and me
and Valentine alone in our wind-beleaguered hill-top hat-box
of a house. You should hear the cows butt against
the walls in the early morning while they feed; you should
also see our back log when the thermometer goes (as it
does go) away&mdash;away below zero, till it can be seen no
more by the eye of man&mdash;not the thermometer, which is
still perfectly visible, but the mercury, which curls up into
the bulb like a hibernating bear; you should also see the
lad who &ldquo;does chores&rdquo; for us, with his red stockings and
his thirteen-year-old face, and his highly manly tramp into
the room; and his two alternative answers to all questions
about the weather: either &ldquo;Cold,&rdquo; or with a really lyrical
movement of the voice, &ldquo;<i>Lovely</i>&mdash;raining!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will you take this miserable scrap for what it is worth?
Will you also understand that I am the man to blame,
and my wife is really almost too much out of health to
write, or at least doesn&rsquo;t write?&mdash;And believe me, with
kind remembrances to Mrs. Boodle and your sisters, very
sincerely yours,</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MISS MONROE</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your letter and

Chicago: had I done&mdash;or if I yet do&mdash;so, I shall hope to

the railroad car as abjectly as I do an earwig, and, on the

and what do you suppose is the name of it? and have you
ever read it yourself? and (I am bound I will get to the
bottom of the page before I blow the gaff, if I have to fight
it out on this line all summer; for if you have not to
turn a leaf, there can be no suspense, the conspectory eye
being swift to pick out proper names; and without suspense,
there can be little pleasure in this world, to my
mind at least)&mdash;and, in short, the name of it is <i>Roderick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
Hudson</i>, if you please. My dear James, it is very spirited,
and very sound, and very noble too. Hudson, Mrs. Hudson,
Rowland, O, all first-rate: Rowland a very fine
fellow; Hudson as good as he can stick (did you know
Hudson? I suspect you did), Mrs. H. his real born mother,
a thing rarely managed in fiction.</p>

<p>We are all keeping pretty fit and pretty hearty; but
this letter is not from me to you, it is from a reader of
<i>R. H.</i> to the author of the same, and it says nothing, and
has nothing to say, but thank you.</p>

<p>We are going to re-read <i>Casamassima</i> as a proper
pendant. Sir, I think these two are your best, and care
not who knows it.</p>

<p>May I beg you, the next time <i>Roderick</i> is printed off,
to go over the sheets of the last few chapters, and strike
out &ldquo;immense&rdquo; and &ldquo;tremendous&rdquo;? You have simply
dropped them there like your pocket-handkerchief; all
you have to do is to pick them up and pouch them, and
your room&mdash;what do I say?&mdash;your cathedral!&mdash;will be
swept and garnished.&mdash;I am, dear sir, your delighted
reader,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Perhaps it is a pang of causeless honesty, perhaps
I hope it will set a value on my praise of <i>Roderick</i>, perhaps
it&rsquo;s a burst of the diabolic, but I must break out with the
news that I can&rsquo;t bear the <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>. I read it all,
and I wept too; but I can&rsquo;t stand your having written it;
and I beg you will write no more of the like. <i>Infra</i>, sir;
Below you: I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;it may be your favourite
work, but in my eyes it&rsquo;s <span class="sc">BELOW YOU</span> to write and me to
read. I thought <i>Roderick</i> was going to be another such
at the beginning; and I cannot describe my pleasure as
I found it taking bones and blood, and looking out at me
with a moved and human countenance, whose lineaments
are written in my memory until my last of days.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac Lake</i> [<i>December</i> 1887].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;This goes to say that we are all fit,
and the place is very bleak and wintry, and up to now
has shown no such charms of climate as Davos, but is a
place where men eat and where the cattarh, catarrh (cattarrh,
or cattarrhh) appears to be unknown. I walk in
my verandy in the snaw, sir, looking down over one of
those dabbled wintry landscapes that are (to be frank) so
chilly to the human bosom, and up at a grey, English&mdash;nay,
<i>mehercle</i>, Scottish&mdash;heaven; and I think it pretty bleak;
and the wind swoops at me round the corner, like a lion,
and fluffs the snow in my face; and I could aspire to be
elsewhere; but yet I do not catch cold, and yet, when I
come in, I eat. So that hitherto Saranac, if not deliriously
delectable, has not been a failure; nay, from the mere
point of view of the wicked body, it has proved a success.
But I wish I could still get to the woods; alas, <i>nous n&rsquo;irons
plus au bois</i> is my poor song; the paths are buried, the
dingles drifted full, a little walk is grown a long one; till
spring comes, I fear the burthen will hold good.</p>

<p>I get along with my papers for Scribner not fast, nor
so far specially well; only this last, the fourth one (which
makes a third part of my whole task), I do believe is
pulled off after a fashion. It is a mere sermon: &ldquo;Smith
opens out&rdquo;;<a name="FnAnchor_24" id="FnAnchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> but it is true, and I find it touching and
beneficial, to me at least; and I think there is some fine
writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases. <i>Pulvis
et Umbra</i>, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
Sermon, if I had wanted. Its sentiments, although parsonic,
will not offend even you, I believe. The other three
papers, I fear, bear many traces of effort, and the ungenuine
inspiration of an income at so much per essay,
and the honest desire of the incomer to give good measure
for his money. Well, I did my damndest anyway.</p>

<p>We have been reading H. James&rsquo;s <i>Roderick Hudson</i>,
which I eagerly press you to get at once: it is a book of
a high order&mdash;the last volume in particular. I wish
Meredith would read it. It took my breath away.</p>

<p>I am at the seventh book of the <i>Ã†neid</i>, and quite
amazed at its merits (also very often floored by its difficulties).
The Circe passage at the beginning, and the
sublime business of Amata with the simile of the boy&rsquo;s
top&mdash;O Lord, what a happy thought!&mdash;have specially
delighted me.&mdash;I am, dear sir, your respected friend,</p>

I have done no more Virgil since I finished the seventh

have fallen head over heels into a new tale, <i>The Master of
Ballantrae</i>. No thought have I now apart from it, and I
have got along up to page ninety-two of the draft with
great interest. It is to me a most seizing tale: there are
some fantastic elements; the most is a dead genuine

therefore pray understand if any element of that hamper
prove unwelcome, <i>it is to be exchanged</i>. I will not sit down
under the name of a giver of White Elephants. I never
had any elephant but one, and his initials were R. L. S.;

a fable, and not in the least to the point: which is that

<div class="quote">
<p>The following letter invites Mr. Baxter to allow himself (under

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac Lake, January</i> &rsquo;88.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;You are the flower of Doers....
Will my doer collaborate thus much in my new novel?
In the year 1794 or 5, Mr. Ephraim Mackellar, A.M., late
steward on the Durrisdeer estates, completed a set of
memoranda (as long as a novel) with regard to the death
of the (then) late Lord Durrisdeer, and as to that of his
attainted elder brother, called by the family courtesy title
the Master of Ballantrae. These he placed in the hand
of John Macbrair, W.S., the family agent, on the understanding
they were to be sealed until 1862, when a century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
would have elapsed since the affair in the wilderness (my
lord&rsquo;s death). You succeeded Mr. Macbrair&rsquo;s firm; the
Durrisdeers are extinct; and last year, in an old green
box, you found these papers with Macbrair&rsquo;s indorsation.
It is that indorsation of which I want a copy; you may
remember, when you gave me the papers, I neglected to
take that, and I am sure you are a man too careful of
antiquities to have let it fall aside. I shall have a little
introduction descriptive of my visit to Edinburgh, arrival
there, denner with yoursel&rsquo;, and first reading of the papers
in your smoking-room: all of which, of course, you well
remember.&mdash;Ever yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="to">To E. L. Burlingame</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Saranac Lake, Winter</i> 1887-88.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR MR. BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;I am keeping the sermon to
see if I can&rsquo;t add another. Meanwhile, I will send you very
soon a different paper which may take its place. Possibly
some of these days soon I may get together a talk on things
current, which should go in (if possible) earlier than either.
I am now less nervous about these papers; I believe I can
do the trick without great strain, though the terror that
breathed on my back in the beginning is not yet forgotten.</p>

<p>The <i>Master of Ballantrae</i> I have had to leave aside, as
I was quite worked out. But in about a week I hope to
try back and send you the first four numbers: these are
all drafted, it is only the revision that has broken me
down, as it is often the hardest work. These four I propose
you should set up for me at once, and we&rsquo;ll copyright
&rsquo;em in a pamphlet. I will tell you the names of the
<i>bona fide</i> purchasers in England.</p>

<p>The numbers will run from twenty to thirty pages of
my manuscript. You can give me that much, can you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
not? It is a howling good tale&mdash;at least these first four
numbers are; the end is a trifle more fantastic, but &rsquo;tis
all picturesque.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t trouble about any more French books; I am on
another scent, you see, just now. Only the <i>French in
Hindustan</i> I await with impatience, as that is for <i>Ballantrae</i>.
The scene of that romance is Scotland&mdash;the States&mdash;Scotland&mdash;India&mdash;Scotland&mdash;and
the States again; so
it jumps like a flea. I have enough about the States now,
and very much obliged I am; yet if Drake&rsquo;s <i>Tragedies of
the Wilderness</i> is (as I gather) a collection of originals, I
should like to purchase it. If it is a picturesque vulgarisation,
I do not wish to look it in the face. Purchase, I say;
for I think it would be well to have some such collection
by me with a view to fresh works.&mdash;Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;If you think of having the <i>Master</i> illustrated, I
suggest that Hole would be very well up to the Scottish,
which is the larger, part. If you have it done here, tell
your artist to look at the hall of Craigievar in Billing&rsquo;s
<i>Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities</i>, and he will get a
broad hint for the hall at Durrisdeer: it is, I think, the
chimney of Craigievar and the roof of Pinkie, and perhaps
a little more of Pinkie altogether; but I should have to
see the book myself to be sure. Hole would be invaluable
for this. I dare say if you had it illustrated, you
could let me have one or two for the English edition.</p>

<p class="to">To William Archer</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following refers to Mr. Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s novel, <i>Cashel Byron&rsquo;s
Profession</i>, which had been sent Stevenson to read by their common
friend Mr. Archer.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, Winter</i> 1887-88.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR ARCHER</span>,&mdash;What am I to say? I have read
your friend&rsquo;s book with singular relish. If he has written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
any other, I beg you will let me see it; and if he has not,
I beg him to lose no time in supplying the deficiency. It
is full of promise; but I should like to know his age. There
are things in it that are very clever, to which I attach
small importance; it is the shape of the age. And there
are passages, particularly the rally in presence of the Zulu
king, that show genuine and remarkable narrative talent&mdash;a
talent that few will have the wit to understand, a talent
of strength, spirit, capacity, sufficient vision, and sufficient
self-sacrifice, which last is the chief point in a narrator.</p>

<p>As a whole, it is (of course) a fever dream of the most
feverish. Over Bashville the footman I howled with
derision and delight; I dote on Bashville&mdash;I could read
of him for ever; <i>de Bashville je suis le fervent</i>&mdash;there is
only one Bashville, and I am his devoted slave; <i>Bashville
est magnifique, mais il n&rsquo;est guÃ¨re possible</i>. He is the note
of the book. It is all mad, mad and deliriously delightful;
the author has a taste in chivalry like Walter Scott&rsquo;s
or Dumas&rsquo;, and then he daubs in little bits of socialism;
he soars away on the wings of the romantic griffon&mdash;even
the griffon, as he cleaves air, shouting with laughter at
the nature of the quest&mdash;and I believe in his heart he
thinks he is labouring in a quarry of solid granite realism.</p>

<p>It is this that makes me&mdash;the most hardened adviser
now extant&mdash;stand back and hold my peace. If Mr.
Shaw is below five-and-twenty, let him go his path; if he
is thirty, he had best be told that he is a romantic, and
pursue romance with his eyes open;&mdash;or perhaps he knows
it;&mdash;God knows!&mdash;my brain is softened.</p>

<p>It is <span class="sc">HORRID FUN</span>. All I ask is more of it. Thank you
for the pleasure you gave us, and tell me more of the
inimitable author.</p>

<p>(I say, Archer, my God, what women!)&mdash;Yours very
truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1">1 part Charles Reade; 1 part Henry James or some
kindred author badly assimilated; &frac12; part Disraeli (perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
unconscious); 1&frac12; parts struggling, over-laid original talent;
1 part blooming, gaseous folly. That is the equation as it
stands. What it may be, I don&rsquo;t know, nor any other man.
<i>Vixere fortes</i>&mdash;O, let him remember that&mdash;let him beware
of his damned century; his gifts of insane chivalry and
animated narration are just those that might be slain and
thrown out like an untimely birth by the Daemon of the
epoch. And if he only knew how I have adored the
chivalry! Bashville!&mdash;<i>O Bashville! j&rsquo;en chortle</i> (which is
fairly polyglot).</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR ARCHER</span>,&mdash;Pretty sick in bed; but necessary
to protest and continue your education.</p>

<p>Why was Jenkin an amateur in my eyes? You think
because not amusing (I think he often was amusing).
The reason is this: I never, or almost never, saw two
pages of his work that I could not have put in one without
the smallest loss of material. That is the only test I
know of writing. If there is anywhere a thing said in
two sentences that could have been as clearly and as
engagingly and as forcibly said in one, then it&rsquo;s amateur
work. Then you will bring me up with old Dumas. Nay,
the object of a story is to be long, to fill up hours; the
story-teller&rsquo;s art of writing is to water out by continual
invention, historical and technical, and yet not seem to
water; seem on the other hand to practise that same wit
of conspicuous and declaratory condensation which is the
proper art of writing. That is one thing in which my
stories fail: I am always cutting the flesh off their bones.</p>

<p>I would rise from the dead to preach!</p>

<p>Hope all well. I think my wife better, but she&rsquo;s not
allowed to write; and this (only wrung from me by desire
to Boss and Parsonise and Dominate, strong in sickness)
is my first letter for days, and will likely be my last for

I saw none then, except a problem in brutality; and I
still consider the problem in that case not established.)
On my way down the <i>FranÃ§ais</i> stairs, I trod on an old
gentleman&rsquo;s toes, whereupon with that suavity that so
well becomes me, I turned about to apologise, and on
the instant, repenting me of that intention, stopped the

effect: No, you are one of the <i>lÃ¢ches</i> who have been

I thought it less than it was worth, but too little to tempt
me to undergo the disagreeables of serial publication.
This tale (if you want it) you are to have; for it is

now, 10.15, just got the dishes washed and the kitchen all
clear, and sit down to give you as much news as I have
spirit for, after such an engagement. Glass is a thing
that really breaks my spirit: I do not like to fail, and
with glass I cannot reach the work of my high calling&mdash;the
artist&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I am, as you may gather from this, wonderfully better:
this harsh, grey, glum, doleful climate has done me good.
You cannot fancy how sad a climate it is. When the
thermometer stays all day below 10Â°, it is really cold;
and when the wind blows, O commend me to the result.
Pleasure in life is all delete; there is no red spot left, fires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
do not radiate, you burn your hands all the time on what
seem to be cold stones. It is odd, zero is like summer
heat to us now; and we like, when the thermometer outside
is really low, a room at about 48Â°: 60Â° we find oppressive.
Yet the natives keep their holes at 90Â° or even 100Â°.</p>

<p>This was interrupted days ago by household labours.
Since then I have had and (I tremble to write it, but it
does seem as if I had) beaten off an influenza. The cold
is exquisite. Valentine still in bed. The proofs of the
first part of <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i> begin to come in;
soon you shall have it in the pamphlet form; and I hope
you will like it. The second part will not be near so good;
but there&mdash;we can but do as it&rsquo;ll do with us. I have
every reason to believe this winter has done me real good,
so far as it has gone; and if I carry out my scheme for
next winter, and succeeding years, I should end by being
a tower of strength. I want you to save a good holiday
for next winter; I hope we shall be able to help you
to some larks. Is there any Greek Isle you would like to
explore? or any creek in Asia Minor?&mdash;Yours ever
affectionately,</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, Winter</i> 1887-88.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR DR. CHARTERIS</span>,&mdash;I have asked Douglas and
Foulis to send you my last volume, so that you may possess
my little paper on my father in a permanent shape; not
for what that is worth, but as a tribute of respect to one
whom my father regarded with such love, esteem, and
affection. Besides, as you will see, I have brought you
under contribution, and I have still to thank you for your
letter to my mother; so more than kind; in much, so
just. It is my hope, when time and health permit, to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
something more definite for my father&rsquo;s memory. You
are one of the very few who can (if you will) help me.
Pray believe that I lay on you no obligation; I know
too well, you may believe me, how difficult it is to put
even two sincere lines upon paper, where all, too, is to
order. But if the spirit should ever move you, and you
should recall something memorable of your friend, his son
will heartily thank you for a note of it.&mdash;With much

has played us false, or you were in my debt. In
case it should be my letter that has failed to come to post,
I must tell again the fate of Mrs. Gosse&rsquo;s thermometer.
It hangs in our sitting-room, where it has often marked
freezing point and below; &ldquo;See what Gosse says,&rdquo; is a
common word of command. But the point is this: in
the verandah hangs another thermometer, condemned to
register minus 40Â° and that class of temperatures; and
to him, we have given the name of the Quarterly Reviewer.
I hope the jape likes you.</p>

<p>Please tell the Fortnightly man that I am sorry but I
can do nothing of that sort this year, as I am under a
pledge to Scribner&rsquo;s; and indeed my monthly articles
take the best of my time. It was a project I went into with
horrid diffidence; and lucre was my only motive. I get
on better than I expected, but it is difficult to find an
article of the sort required for each date, and to vary the
matter and keep up (if possible) the merit. I do not know
if you think I have at all succeeded; it seemed to me
this really worked paper was more money&rsquo;s worth (as well
as probably better within my means) than the Lang

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, March</i> 1888.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR DELIGHTFUL JAMES</span>,&mdash;To quote your heading
to my wife, I think no man writes so elegant a letter, I
am sure none so kind, unless it be Colvin, and there is
more of the stern parent about him. I was vexed at your
account of my admired Meredith: I wish I could go and
see him; as it is I will try to write; and yet (do you
understand me?) there is something in that potent, <i>genialisch</i>
affectation that puts one on the strain even to address
him in a letter. He is not an easy man to be yourself
with: there is so much of him, and veracity and the
high athletic intellectual humbug are so intermixed.<a name="FnAnchor_26" id="FnAnchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> I
read with indescribable admiration your <i>Emerson</i>. I begin
to long for the day when these portraits of yours shall
be collected: do put me in. But Emerson is a higher
flight. Have you a <i>Tourgueneff</i>? You have told me
many interesting things of him, and I seem to see them
written, and forming a graceful and <i>bildend</i> sketch. (I
wonder whence comes this flood of German&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t
opened a German book since I teethed.) My novel is a
tragedy; four parts out of six or seven are written, and
gone to Burlingame. Five parts of it are sound, human
tragedy; the last one or two, I regret to say, not so soundly
designed; I almost hesitate to write them; they are very
picturesque, but they are fantastic; they shame, perhaps
degrade, the beginning. I wish I knew; that was how
the tale came to me however. I got the situation; it was
an old taste of mine: The older brother goes out in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
&rsquo;45, the younger stays; the younger, of course, gets title
and estate and marries the bride designate of the elder&mdash;a
family match, but he (the younger) had always loved
her, and she had really loved the elder. Do you see the
situation? Then the devil and Saranac suggested this
<i>dÃ©nouement</i>, and I joined the two ends in a day or two of
constant feverish thought, and began to write. And now&mdash;I
wonder if I have not gone too far with the fantastic?
The elder brother is an <span class="sc">INCUBUS</span>: supposed to be killed
at Culloden, he turns up again and bleeds the family of
money; on that stopping he comes and lives with them,
whence flows the real tragedy, the nocturnal duel of the
brothers (very naturally, and indeed, I think, inevitably
arising), and second supposed death of the elder. Husband
and wife now really make up, and then the cloven hoof
appears. For the third supposed death and the manner
of the third reappearance is steep; steep, sir. It is even
very steep, and I fear it shames the honest stuff so far;
but then it is highly pictorial, and it leads up to the death
of the elder brother at the hands of the younger in a perfectly
cold-blooded murder, of which I wish (and mean)
the reader to approve. You see how daring is the design.
There are really but six characters, and one of these episodic,
and yet it covers eighteen years, and will be, I imagine,
the longest of my works.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR DR. CHARTERIS</span>,&mdash;The funeral letter, your notes,
and many other things, are reserved for a book, <i>Memorials
of a Scottish Family</i>, if ever I can find time and opportunity.
I wish I could throw off all else and sit down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
to it to-day. Yes, my father was a &ldquo;distinctly religious
man,&rdquo; but not a pious. The distinction painfully and
pleasurably recalls old conflicts; it used to be my great
gun&mdash;and you, who suffered for the whole Church, know
how needful it was to have some reserve artillery! His
sentiments were tragic; he was a tragic thinker. Now,
granted that life is tragic to the marrow, it seems the
proper function of religion to make us accept and serve
in that tragedy, as officers in that other and comparable
one of war. Service is the word, active service, in the
military sense; and the religious man&mdash;I beg pardon,
the pious man&mdash;is he who has a military joy in duty&mdash;not
he who weeps over the wounded. We can do no more than
try to do our best. Really, I am the grandson of the
manse&mdash;I preach you a kind of sermon. Box the brat&rsquo;s
ears!</p>

<p>My mother&mdash;to pass to matters more within my competence&mdash;finely
enjoys herself. The new country, some
new friends we have made, the interesting experiment of
this climate&mdash;which (at least) is tragic&mdash;all have done her
good. I have myself passed a better winter than for years,
and now that it is nearly over have some diffident hopes
of doing well in the summer and &ldquo;eating a little more
air&rdquo; than usual.</p>

<p>I thank you for the trouble you are taking, and my
mother joins with me in kindest regards to yourself and
Mrs. Charteris.&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

O, man, I cannae read your name!&mdash;That I have been
so long in answering your delightful letter sits on my conscience
badly. The fact is I let my correspondence accumulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
until I am going to leave a place; and then I pitch
in, overhaul the pile, and my cries of penitence might be
heard a mile about. Yesterday I despatched thirty-five
belated letters: conceive the state of my conscience, above
all as the Sins of Omission (see boyhood&rsquo;s guide, the Shorter
Catechism) are in my view the only serious ones; I call it
my view, but it cannot have escaped you that it was
also Christ&rsquo;s. However, all that is not to the purpose,
which is to thank you for the sincere pleasure afforded by
your charming letter. I get a good few such; how few
that please me at all, you would be surprised to learn&mdash;or
have a singularly just idea of the dulness of our race;
how few that please me as yours did, I can tell you in one
word&mdash;<i>None</i>. I am no great kirkgoer, for many reasons&mdash;and
the sermon&rsquo;s one of them, and the first prayer
another, but the chief and effectual reason is the stuffiness.
I am no great kirkgoer, says I, but when I read yon letter
of yours, I thought I would like to sit under ye. And then
I saw ye were to send me a bit buik, and says I, I&rsquo;ll wait

And, man! the buik was ne&rsquo;er heard tell o&rsquo;!</p>

<p>That fact is an adminicle of excuse for my delay.</p>

<p>And now, dear minister of the illegible name, thanks

<p class="to">To Miss Ferrier</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Saranac Lake, April</i> 1888.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAREST COGGIE</span>,&mdash;I wish I could find the letter I
began to you some time ago when I was ill; but I can&rsquo;t
and I don&rsquo;t believe there was much in it anyway. We
have all behaved like pigs and beasts and barn-door
poultry to you; but I have been sunk in work, and the
lad is lazy and blind and has been working too; and as
for Fanny, she has been (and still is) really unwell. I had
a mean hope you might perhaps write again before I got
up steam: I could not have been more ashamed of
myself than I am, and I should have had another
laugh.</p>

<p>They always say I cannot give news in my letters: I
shall shake off that reproach. On Monday, if she is well
enough, Fanny leaves for California to see her friends; it
is rather an anxiety to let her go alone; but the doctor
simply forbids it in my case, and she is better anywhere
than here&mdash;a bleak, blackguard, beggarly climate, of which
I can say no good except that it suits me and some others
of the same or similar persuasions whom (by all rights)
it ought to kill. It is a form of Arctic St. Andrews, I
should imagine; and the miseries of forty degrees below
zero, with a high wind, have to be felt to be appreciated.
The greyness of the heavens here is a circumstance eminently
revolting to the soul; I have near forgot the aspect of the
sun&mdash;I doubt if this be news; it is certainly no news to
us. My mother suffers a little from the inclemency of the
place, but less on the whole than would be imagined.
Among other wild schemes, we have been projecting yacht
voyages; and I beg to inform you that Cogia Hassan
was cast for the part of passenger. They may come off!&mdash;Again
this is not news. The lad? Well, the lad wrote
a tale this winter, which appeared to me so funny that I
have taken it in hand, and some of these days you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
receive a copy of a work entitled &ldquo;<i>A Game of Bluff</i>, by
Lloyd Osbourne and Robert Louis Stevenson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otherwise he (the lad) is much as usual. There remains,
I believe, to be considered only R. L. S., the house-bond,
prop, pillar, bread-winner, and bully of the establishment.
Well, I do not think him much better; he is
making piles of money; the hope of being able to hire a
yacht ere long dances before his eyes; otherwise he is
not in very high spirits at this particular moment, though
compared with last year at Bournemouth an angel of joy.</p>

<p>And now is this news, Cogia, or is it not? It all depends
upon the point of view, and I call it news. The devil of
it is that I can think of nothing else, except to send you
all our loves, and to wish exceedingly you were here to
cheer us all up. But we&rsquo;ll see about that on board the
yacht.&mdash;Your affectionate friend,</p>

quite for a private eye, but they ran me so hard that I
could not write without lugging them in, which (for several
reasons) I did not choose to do. Fanny is off to San

(I was going to say) care; so bald and bad is my frame
of mind. Do you know our&mdash;ahem!&mdash;fellow clubman,
Colonel Majendie? I had such an interesting letter from
him. Did you see my sermon? It has evoked the worst
feeling: I fear people don&rsquo;t care for the truth, or else
I don&rsquo;t tell it. Suffer me to wander without purpose. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
have sent off twenty letters to-day, and begun and stuck
at a twenty-first, and taken a copy of one which was on
business, and corrected several galleys of proof, and sorted
about a bushel of old letters; so if any one has a right
to be romantically stupid it is I&mdash;and I am. Really deeply
stupid, and at that stage when in old days I used to pour
out words without any meaning whatever and with my
mind taking no part in the performance. I suspect that
is now the case. I am reading with extraordinary pleasure
the life of Lord Lawrence: Lloyd and I have a mutiny
novel&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>Next morning, after twelve other letters</i>)&mdash;mutiny novel
on hand&mdash;a tremendous work&mdash;so we are all at Indian
books. The idea of the novel is Lloyd&rsquo;s: I call it a novel.
&rsquo;Tis a tragic romance, of the most tragic sort: I believe
the end will be almost too much for human endurance&mdash;when
the hero is thrown to the ground with one of his
own (Sepoy) soldier&rsquo;s knees upon his chest, and the cries
begin in the Beebeeghar. O truly, you know it is a howler!
The whole last part is&mdash;well the difficulty is that, short of
resuscitating Shakespeare, I don&rsquo;t know who is to write it.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GAMEKEEPER</span>,&mdash;Your p.c. (proving you a good
student of Micawber) has just arrived, and it paves the
way to something I am anxious to say. I wrote a paper
the other day&mdash;<i>Pulvis et Umbra</i>;&mdash;I wrote it with great
feeling and conviction: to me it seemed bracing and
healthful, it is in such a world (so seen by me), that I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
very glad to fight out my battle, and see some fine sunsets,
and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the
camp fire. But I find that to some people this vision of
mine is a nightmare, and extinguishes all ground of faith
in God or pleasure in man. Truth I think not so much of;
for I do not know it. And I could wish in my heart that
I had not published this paper, if it troubles folk too much:
all have not the same digestion, nor the same sight of
things. And it came over me with special pain that perhaps
this article (which I was at the pains to send to her)
might give dismalness to my <i>Gamekeeper at Home</i>. Well,
I cannot take back what I have said; but yet I may add
this. If my view be everything but the nonsense that it
may be&mdash;to me it seems self-evident and blinding truth&mdash;surely
of all things it makes this world holier. There is
nothing in it but the moral side&mdash;but the great battle
and the breathing times with their refreshments. I see
no more and no less. And if you look again, it is not
ugly, and it is filled with promise.</p>

<p>Pray excuse a desponding author for this apology.
My wife is away off to the uttermost parts of the States,
all by herself. I shall be off, I hope, in a week; but
where? Ah! that I know not. I keep wonderful, and

on the outer beach, the lagoon as smooth as glass, all the
little, queer, many coloured villas standing shuttered and
empty; in front of ours, across the lagoon, two long
wooden bridges; one for the rail, one for the road, sounding
with intermittent traffic. It is highly pleasant, and a
delightful change from Saranac. My health is much better
for the change; I am sure I walked about four miles

schooner yacht <i>Casco</i>, for a seven months&rsquo; cruise in the
South Seas. You can conceive what a state of excitement
we are in; Lloyd perhaps first; but this is an old dream
of mine which actually seems to be coming true, and I
am sun-struck. It seems indeed too good to be true;
and that we have not deserved so much good fortune.
From Skerryvore to the Galapagos is a far cry! And
from poking in a sick-room all winter to the deck of one&rsquo;s
own ship, is indeed a heavenly change.</p>

<p>All these seven months I doubt if we can expect more
than three mails at the best of it: and I do hope we may
hear something of your news by each. I have no very
clear views as to where the three addresses ought to be,
but if you hear no later news, Charles Scribner&rsquo;s Sons
will always have the run of our intended movements.
And an early letter there would probably catch us at the
Sandwich Islands. Tahiti will probably be the second
point: and (as I roughly guess) Quito the third. But
the whole future is invested with heavenly clouds.</p>

<p>I trust you are all well and content, and have good
news of the Shelleys, to whom I wish you would pass on
ours. They should be able to sympathise with our delight.</p>

no interest whatever in the introduction, and in the most

point in your character. You were also (I use the

My time of observation was so limited that you must
pardon me if I can say no more: what else I marked, what
restlessness of foot and hand, what graceful clumsiness,
what experimental designs upon the furniture, was but the
common inheritance of human youth. But you may
perhaps like to know that the lean flushed man in bed,
who interested you so little, was in a state of mind extremely
mingled and unpleasant: harassed with work which he
thought he was not doing well, troubled with difficulties

the Beltraffio volume to Low, and it has brought him to
his knees; he was <i>amazed</i> at the first part of Georgina&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
Reasons, although (like me) not so well satisfied with
Part <span class="sc">II.</span> It is annoying to find the American public as
stupid as the English, but they will waken up in time:
I wonder what they will think of <i>Two Nations</i>?...</p>

<p>This, dear James, is a valedictory. On June 15th the
schooner yacht <i>Casco</i> will (weather and a jealous providence
permitting) steam through the Golden Gates for
Honolulu, Tahiti, the Galapagos, Guayaquil, and&mdash;I hope
<i>not</i> the bottom of the Pacific. It will contain your
obedient &rsquo;umble servant and party. It seems too good to
be true, and is a very good way of getting through the
green-sickness of maturity which, with all its accompanying
ills, is now declaring itself in my mind and life. They
tell me it is not so severe as that of youth; if I (and the
<i>Casco</i>) are spared, I shall tell you more exactly, as I am
one of the few people in the world who do not forget their
own lives.</p>

<p>Good-bye, then, my dear fellow, and please write us a
word; we expect to have three mails in the next two
months: Honolulu, Tahiti, and Guayaquil. But letters
will be forwarded from Scribner&rsquo;s, if you hear nothing
more definite directly. In 3 (three) days I leave for San
Francisco.&mdash;Ever yours most cordially,</p>

<h3>PACIFIC VOYAGES</h3>

<h4>YACHT <i>CASCO</i>&mdash;SCHOONER <i>EQUATOR</i>&mdash;S.S.
<i>JANET NICOLL</i></h4>

<h5><span class="sc">June 1888-October 1890</span></h5>


<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> the following section are printed nearly all the letters
which reached Stevenson&rsquo;s correspondents in England and
the United States, at intervals necessarily somewhat rare,
during the eighteen months of his Pacific voyages. It
was on the 28th of June 1888 that he started from the
harbour of San Francisco on what was only intended to
be a health and pleasure excursion of a few months&rsquo; duration,
but turned into a voluntary exile prolonged until
the hour of his death. His company consisted, besides
himself, of his wife, his mother, his stepson Mr. Lloyd
Osbourne, and the servant Valentine Roch. They sailed
on board the schooner yacht <i>Casco</i>, Captain Otis, and
made straight for the Marquesas, dropping anchor on the
28th of July in Anaho Bay, the harbour of the island of
Nukahiva. The magic effect of this first island landfall
on his mind he has described in the opening chapter of his
book <i>In the South Seas</i>. After spending six weeks in this
group they sailed south-eastwards, visiting (a sufficiently
perilous piece of navigation) several of the coral atolls of
the Paumotus or Low Archipelago. Thence they arrived
in the first week of October at the Tahitian group or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
&ldquo;Society&rdquo; islands. In these their longest stay was not
at the chief town, Papeete, where Stevenson fell sharply
ill, but in a more secluded and very beautiful station,
Tautira, whither he went to recruit, and where they were
detained by the necessity of remasting the schooner.
Here Stevenson and one of the local chiefs, Ori a Ori,
made special friends and parted with heartfelt mutual
regret. Mrs. Stevenson is good enough to allow me to
supplement the somewhat fragmentary account of these
adventures given in his letters with one or two of her
own, in which they are told with full vividness and detail.</p>

<p>Sailing from Tahiti due northwards through forty
degrees of latitude, the party arrived about Christmas at
Honolulu, the more than semi-civilised capital of the
Hawaiian group (Sandwich Islands), where they paid off
the yacht <i>Casco</i> and made a stay of nearly six months.
Here Stevenson finished <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i> and <i>The
Wrong Box</i>; and hence his mother returned for a while
to Scotland, to rejoin her son&rsquo;s household when it was
fairly installed two years later at Vailima. From Honolulu
Stevenson made several excursions, including one,
which profoundly impressed him, to the leper settlement
at Molokai, the scene of Father Damien&rsquo;s ministrations and
death.</p>

<p>This first year of cruising and residence among the
Pacific Islands had resulted in so encouraging a renewal
of health, with so keen a zest added to life by the restored
capacity for outdoor activity and adventure, that Stevenson
determined to prolong his experiences in yet more
remote archipelagoes of the same ocean. He started
accordingly from Honolulu in June 1889 on a trading
schooner, the <i>Equator</i>, bound to the Gilberts, one of the
least visited and most primitively mannered of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
island groups of the Western Pacific; emerged towards
Christmas of the same year into semi-civilisation again at
Apia, on the island of Upolu in Samoa, where he wrote his
first Polynesian story, <i>The Bottle Imp</i>. Enchanted with
the scenery and the people, he stayed for six weeks, first
in the house of Mr. H. J. Moors, a leading American trader,
then with his family in a separate cottage not far off;
bought an estate on the densely wooded mountain side
above Apia, with the notion of making there, if not a home,
at least a place of rest and call on later projected excursions
among the islands; and began to make collections
for his studies in recent Samoan history. In February he
went on to Sydney to find his correspondence and consider
future plans. It was during this stay at Sydney that he
was moved to give expression to his righteous indignation
at the terms of a letter concerning Father Damien by the
Rev. Dr. Hyde of Honolulu. Here also he fell once more
seriously ill, with a renewal of all his old symptoms; and
the conclusion was forced upon him that he must take up
his residence for the rest of his life in the tropics&mdash;though
with occasional excursions, as he then hoped, at least
half-way homeward to places where it might be possible
for friends from England to meet him. In order to shake
off the effects of this attack, he started with his party on
a fresh sea voyage from Sydney, this time on a trading
steamer, the <i>Janet Nicoll</i>, which took him by a very devious
course to the Gilberts again, the Marshalls, and among
many other remote islands during the months of April-August
1890. During the voyage he began to put into
shape the notes for a volume on the South Seas which
he had been compiling ever since he left San Francisco.
Unfortunately, he persisted in the endeavour to make his
work impersonal and full of information, or what he called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
&ldquo;serious interest,&rdquo; exactly in the manner which his wife
had foreseen before they left Honolulu, and from which
she had wisely tried to dissuade him (see her letter printed
on pp. 347 foll.). On the return voyage Stevenson left the
<i>Janet Nicoll</i> to land in New Caledonia, staying for some
days at Noumea before he went on to Sydney, where he
spent four or five weeks of later August and September.
Thence he returned in October to take up his abode for
good on his Samoan property, where the work of clearing,
planting, and building a habitable cottage had been going
on busily during his absence.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;From this somewhat (ahem) out of
the way place, I write to say how d&rsquo;ye do. It is all a
swindle: I chose these isles as having the most beastly
population, and they are far better, and far more civilised
than we. I know one old chief Ko-o-amua, a great cannibal
in his day, who ate his enemies even as he walked
home from killing &rsquo;em, and he is a perfect gentleman and
exceedingly amiable and simple-minded: no fool, though.</p>

<p>The climate is delightful; and the harbour where we
lie one of the loveliest spots imaginable. Yesterday evening
we had near a score natives on board; lovely parties.
We have a native god; very rare now. Very rare and
equally absurd to view.</p>

<p>This sort of work is not favourable to correspondence:
it takes me all the little strength I have to go about and
see, and then come home and note, the strangeness around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
us. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if there came trouble here some
day, all the same. I could name a nation that is not
beloved in certain islands&mdash;and it does not know it!
Strange: like ourselves, perhaps, in India! Love to all
and much to yourself.</p>

<p class="rt">7 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, <i>September 6th,</i> 1888, <i>with a dreadful pen.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;Last night as I lay under my
blanket in the cockpit, courting sleep, I had a comic seizure.
There was nothing visible but the southern stars, and the
steersman there out by the binnacle lamp; we were all
looking forward to a most deplorable landfall on the
morrow, praying God we should fetch a tuft of palms
which are to indicate the Dangerous Archipelago; the
night was as warm as milk, and all of a sudden I had a
vision of&mdash;Drummond Street. It came on me like a flash
of lightning: I simply returned thither, and into the
past. And when I remember all I hoped and feared as
I pickled about Rutherford&rsquo;s in the rain and the east wind;
how I feared I should make a mere shipwreck, and yet
timidly hoped not; how I feared I should never have a
friend, far less a wife, and yet passionately hoped I might;
how I hoped (if I did not take to drink) I should possibly
write one little book, etc. etc. And then now&mdash;what a
change! I feel somehow as if I should like the incident
set upon a brass plate at the corner of that dreary thoroughfare
for all students to read, poor devils, when their hearts
are down. And I felt I must write one word to you.
Excuse me if I write little: when I am at sea, it gives me
a headache; when I am in port, I have my diary crying
&ldquo;Give, give.&rdquo; I shall have a fine book of travels, I feel
sure; and will tell you more of the South Seas after very
few months than any other writer has done&mdash;except

<p class="rt"><i>Fakarava, Low Archipelago, September 21st,</i> 1888.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Only a word. Get out your big
atlas, and imagine a straight line from San Francisco to
Anaho, the N.E. corner of Nukahiva, one of the Marquesas
Islands; imagine three weeks there: imagine a
day&rsquo;s sail on August 12th round the eastern end of the
island to Tai-o-hae, the capital; imagine us there till
August 22nd: imagine us skirt the east side of Ua-pu&mdash;perhaps
Rona-Poa on your atlas&mdash;and through the Bordelais
straits to Taa-hauku in Hiva-Oa, where we arrive on
the 23rd; imagine us there until September 4th, when
we sailed for Fakarava, which we reached on the 9th,
after a very difficult and dangerous passage among these
isles. Tuesday, we shall leave for Taiti, where I shall
knock off and do some necessary work ashore. It looks
pretty bald in the atlas; not in fact; nor I trust in the
130 odd pages of diary which I have just been looking up
for these dates: the interest, indeed, has been <i>incredible</i>:
I did not dream there were such places or such races.
My health has stood me splendidly; I am in for hours
wading over the knees for shells; I have been five hours
on horseback: I have been up pretty near all night waiting
to see where the <i>Casco</i> would go ashore, and with my
diary all ready&mdash;simply the most entertaining night of my
life. Withal I still have colds; I have one now, and feel
pretty sick too; but not as at home: instead of being in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
bed, for instance, I am at this moment sitting snuffling
and writing in an undershirt and trousers; and as for
colour, hands, arms, feet, legs, and face, I am browner
than the berry: only my trunk and the aristocratic spot
on which I sit retain the vile whiteness of the north.</p>

<p>Please give my news and kind love to Henley, Henry
James, and any whom you see of well-wishers. Accept
from me the very best of my affection: and believe me
ever yours,</p>

<p class="rt pt2"><i>Papeete, Taiti, October 7th,</i> 1888.</p>

<p>Never having found a chance to send this off, I may
add more of my news. My cold took a very bad turn,
and I am pretty much out of sorts at this particular, living
in a little bare one-twentieth-furnished house, surrounded
by mangoes, etc. All the rest are well, and I mean to be
soon. But these Taiti colds are very severe and, to children,
often fatal; so they were not the thing for me. Yesterday
the brigantine came in from San Francisco, so we can get
our letters off soon. There are in Papeete at this moment,
in a little wooden house with grated verandahs, two people
who love you very much, and one of them is</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Taiti, as ever was, 6th October</i> 1888.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash; ... You will receive a lot of
mostly very bad proofs of photographs: the paper was so
bad. Please keep them very private, as they are for the
book. We send them, having learned so dread a fear of the
sea, that we wish to put our eggs in different baskets. We
have been thrice within an ace of being ashore: we were
lost (!) for about twelve hours in the Low Archipelago,
but by God&rsquo;s blessing had quiet weather all the time; and
once in a squall, we cam so near gaun heels ower hurdies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
that I really dinnae ken why we didnae a&rsquo;thegither. Hence,
as I say, a great desire to put our eggs in different baskets,
particularly on the Pacific (aw-haw-haw) Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>You can have no idea what a mean time we have had,
owing to incidental beastlinesses, nor what a glorious,
owing to the intrinsic interest of these isles. I hope the
book will be a good one; nor do I really very much doubt
that&mdash;the stuff is so curious; what I wonder is, if the
public will rise to it. A copy of my journal, or as much
of it as is made, shall go to you also; it is, of course, quite
imperfect, much being to be added and corrected; but
O, for the eggs in the different baskets.</p>

<p>All the rest are well enough, and all have enjoyed the
cruise so far, in spite of its drawbacks. We have had an
awfae time in some ways, Mr. Baxter; and if I wasnae
sic a verra patient man (when I ken that I <i>have</i> to be)
there wad hae been a braw row; and ance if I hadnae
happened to be on deck about three in the marnin&rsquo;, I <i>think</i>
there would have been <i>murder</i> done. The American
Mairchant Marine is a kent service; ye&rsquo;ll have heard its
praise, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; if ye never did, ye can get <i>Twa

<p><span class="scs">DEAR GIVER</span>,&mdash;I am at a loss to conceive your object

The number of thousand miles that I have travelled,
the strange bed-fellows with which I have been made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
acquainted, I lack the requisite literary talent to make
clear to your imagination. I speak of bed-fellows; pocket-fellows
would be a more exact expression, for the place of
my abode is in my master&rsquo;s right-hand trouser-pocket;
and there, as he waded on the resounding beaches of
Nukahiva, or in the shallow tepid water on the reef of
Fakarava, I have been overwhelmed by and buried among
all manner of abominable South Sea shells, beautiful
enough in their way, I make no doubt, but singular company
for any self-respecting paper-cutter. He, my master&mdash;or
as I more justly call him, my bearer; for although I
occasionally serve him, does not he serve me daily and all
day long, carrying me like an African potentate on my
subject&rsquo;s legs?&mdash;<i>he</i> is delighted with these isles, and this
climate, and these savages, and a variety of other things.
He now blows a flageolet with singular effects: sometimes
the poor thing appears stifled with shame, sometimes it
screams with agony; he pursues his career with truculent
insensibility. Health appears to reign in the party. I
was very nearly sunk in a squall. I am sorry I ever left

<p class="rt"><i>Taiti, October 16th,</i> 1888.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;The cruiser for San Francisco
departs to-morrow morning bearing you some kind of a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
way of Auckland. It contains a ballant; and I think a
better ballant than I expected ever to do. I can imagine
how you will wag your pow over it; and how ragged you
will find it, etc., but has it not spirit all the same? and
though the verse is not all your fancy painted it, has it
not some life? And surely, as narrative, the thing has
considerable merit! Read it, get a typewritten copy
taken, and send me that and your opinion to the Sandwiches.
I know I am only courting the most excruciating
mortification; but the real cause of my sending the thing
is that I could bear to go down myself, but not to have
much MS. go down with me. To say truth, we are through
the most dangerous; but it has left in all minds a strong

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;I think we shall leave here if all is well on
Monday. I am quite recovered, astonishingly recovered.
It must be owned these climates and this voyage have
given me more strength than I could have thought possible.
And yet the sea is a terrible place, stupefying to the
mind and poisonous to the temper, the sea, the motion,
the lack of space, the cruel publicity, the villainous tinned
foods, the sailors, the captain, the passengers&mdash;but you are
amply repaid when you sight an island, and drop anchor
in a new world. Much trouble has attended this trip, but
I must confess more pleasure. Nor should I ever complain,
as in the last few weeks, with the curing of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
illness indeed, as if that were the bursting of an abscess,
the cloud has risen from my spirits and to some degree from
my temper. Do you know what they called the <i>Casco</i> at
Fakarava? The <i>Silver Ship</i>. Is that not pretty? Pray
tell Mrs. Jenkin, <i>die silberne Frau</i>, as I only learned it
since I wrote her. I think of calling the book by that
name: <i>The Cruise of the Silver Ship</i>&mdash;so there will be
one poetic page at least&mdash;the title. At the Sandwiches
we shall say farewell to the <i>S. S.</i> with mingled feelings.
She is a lovely creature: the most beautiful thing at this
moment in Taiti.</p>

<p>Well, I will take another sheet, though I know I have
nothing to say. You would think I was bursting: but
the voyage is all stored up for the book, which is to pay
for it, we fondly hope; and the troubles of the time are
not worth telling; and our news is little.</p>

<p>Here I conclude (Oct. 24th, I think), for we are now
stored, and the Blue Peter metaphorically flies.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Taiti, October 17th,</i> 1888.</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR ARCHER</span>,&mdash;Though quite unable to write letters
I nobly send you a line signifying nothing. The voyage
has agreed well with all; it has had its pains, and its
extraordinary pleasures; nothing in the world can equal
the excitement of the first time you cast anchor in some
bay of a tropical island, and the boats begin to surround
you, and the tattooed people swarm aboard. Tell Tomarcher,
with my respex, that hide-and-seek is not equal to
it; no, nor hidee-in-the-dark; which, for the matter of
that, is a game for the unskilful: the artist prefers daylight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
a good-sized garden, some shrubbery, an open paddock,
and&mdash;come on, Macduff.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tomarcher</span>, I am now a distinguished litterytour, but
that was not the real bent of my genius. I was the best
player of hide-and-seek going; not a good runner, I was
up to every shift and dodge, I could jink very well, I could
crawl without any noise through leaves, I could hide under
a carrot plant, it used to be my favourite boast that I
always <i>walked</i> into the den. You may care to hear,
Tomarcher, about the children in these parts; their parents
obey them, they do not obey their parents; and I am
sorry to tell you (for I dare say you are already thinking
the idea a good one) that it does not pay one halfpenny.
There are three sorts of civilisation, Tomarcher: the real
old-fashioned one, in which children either had to find out
how to please their dear papas, or their dear papas cut
their heads off. This style did very well, but is now out
of fashion. Then the modern European style: in which
children have to behave reasonably well, and go to school
and say their prayers, or their dear papas <i>will know the
reason why</i>. This does fairly well. Then there is the
South Sea Island plan, which does not do one bit. The
children beat their parents here; it does not make their
parents any better; so do not try it.</p>

a beastly thing to ask, but it, after all, does no
earthly harm, only that much good. And besides,
like enough there&rsquo;s nothing in the till, and there is an
end. Yet I live here in the full lustre of millions; it is
thought I am the richest son of man that has yet been

lying in pawn, perhaps for the remainder of my days, in
San Francisco. As usual, my colds have much hashed

<p>The following is the draft of a proposed dedication to the South
Sea travel-book which was to be the fruit of the present voyages, as
is explained in a note at the end.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>November 11th,</i> 1888.</p>

<p><i>One November night, in the village of Tautira, we sat at
the high table in the hall of assembly, hearing the natives sing.
It was dark in the hall, and very warm; though at times the
land wind blew a little shrewdly through the chinks, and at
times, through the larger openings, we could see the moonlight
on the lawn. As the songs arose in the rattling Tahitian
chorus, the chief translated here and there a verse. Farther
on in the volume you shall read the songs themselves; and I
am in hopes that not you only, but all who can find a savour
in the ancient poetry of places, will read them with some
pleasure. You are to conceive us, therefore, in strange circumstances
and very pleasing; in a strange land and climate,
the most beautiful on earth; surrounded by a foreign race
that all travellers have agreed to be the most engaging; and
taking a double interest in two foreign arts.</i></p>

<p><i>We came forth again at last, in a cloudy moonlight, on
the forest lawn which is the street of Tautira. The Pacific
roared outside upon the reef. Here and there one of the
scattered palm-built lodges shone out under the shadow of the
wood, the lamplight bursting through the crannies of the wall.
We went homeward slowly, Ori a Ori carrying behind us the
lantern and the chairs, properties with which we had just been
enacting our part of the distinguished visitor. It was one of
those moments in which minds not altogether churlish recall
the names and deplore the absence of congenial friends; and
it was your name that first rose upon our lips. &ldquo;How
Symonds would have enjoyed this evening!&rdquo; said one, and
then another. The word caught in my mind; I went to bed,
and it was still there. The glittering, frosty solitudes in which
your days are cast arose before me: I seemed to see you walking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
there in the late night, under the pine-trees and the stars;
and I received the image with something like remorse.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a modern attitude towards Fortune; in this
place I will not use a graver name. Staunchly to withstand
her buffets and to enjoy with equanimity her favours was the
code of the virtuous of old. Our fathers, it should seem,
wondered and doubted how they had merited their misfortunes:
we, rather how we have deserved our happiness. And we
stand often abashed, and sometimes revolted, at those partialities
of fate by which we profit most. It was so with me
on that November night: I felt that our positions should be
changed. It was you, dear Symonds, who should have gone
upon that voyage and written this account. With your rich
stores of knowledge, you could have remarked and understood
a thousand things of interest and beauty that escaped my
ignorance; and the brilliant colours of your style would have
carried into a thousand sickrooms the sea air and the strong
sun of tropic islands. It was otherwise decreed. But suffer
me at least to connect you, if only in name and only in the
fondness of imagination, with the voyage of the</i> Silver Ship.</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><span class="scs">DEAR SYMONDS</span>,&mdash;I send you this (November 11th), the
morning of its completion. If I ever write an account of
this voyage, may I place this letter at the beginning?
It represents&mdash;I need not tell you, for you too are an
artist&mdash;a most genuine feeling, which kept me long awake
last night; and though perhaps a little elaborate, I think
it a good piece of writing. We are <i>in heaven here</i>. Do

<p class="to">To Thomas Archer</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Tautira, Island of Taiti</i> [<i>November</i> 1888].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR TOMARCHER</span>,&mdash;This is a pretty state of things!
seven o&rsquo;clock and no word of breakfast! And I was awake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
a good deal last night, for it was full moon, and they had
made a great fire of cocoa-nut husks down by the sea,
and as we have no blinds or shutters, this kept my room
very bright. And then the rats had a wedding or a school-feast
under my bed. And then I woke early, and I have
nothing to read except Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Ã†neid</i>, which is not good
fun on an empty stomach, and a Latin dictionary, which
is good for naught, and by some humorous accident, your
dear papa&rsquo;s article on Skerryvore. And I read the whole
of that, and very impudent it is, but you must not tell
your dear papa I said so, or it might come to a battle in
which you might lose either a dear papa or a valued correspondent,
or both, which would be prodigal. And still no
breakfast; so I said &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s write to Tomarcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a much better place for children than any I
have hitherto seen in these seas. The girls (and sometimes
the boys) play a very elaborate kind of hopscotch. The
boys play horses exactly as we do in Europe; and have
very good fun on stilts, trying to knock each other down,
in which they do not often succeed. The children of all
ages go to church and are allowed to do what they please,
running about the aisles, rolling balls, stealing mamma&rsquo;s
bonnet and publicly sitting on it, and at last going to
sleep in the middle of the floor. I forgot to say that the
whips to play horses, and the balls to roll about the church&mdash;at
least I never saw them used elsewhere&mdash;grow ready
made on trees; which is rough on toy-shops. The whips
are so good that I wanted to play horses myself; but no
such luck! my hair is grey, and I am a great, big, ugly
man. The balls are rather hard, but very light and quite
round. When you grow up and become offensively rich,
you can charter a ship in the port of London, and have
it come back to you entirely loaded with these balls; when
you could satisfy your mind as to their character, and give
them away when done with to your uncles and aunts.
But what I really wanted to tell you was this: besides the
tree-top toys (Hush-a-by, toy-shop, on the tree-top!), I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
have seen some real <i>made</i> toys, the first hitherto observed
in the South Seas.</p>

<p>This was how. You are to imagine a four-wheeled gig;
one horse; in the front seat two Tahiti natives, in their
Sunday clothes, blue coat, white shirt, kilt (a little longer
than the Scotch) of a blue stuff with big white or yellow
flowers, legs and feet bare; in the back seat me and my
wife, who is a friend of yours; under our feet, plenty of
lunch and things: among us a great deal of fun in broken
Tahitian, one of the natives, the sub-chief of the village,
being a great ally of mine. Indeed we have exchanged
names; so that he is now called Rui, the nearest they can
come to Louis, for they have no <i>l</i> and no <i>s</i> in their language.
Rui is six feet three in his stockings, and a magnificent
man. We all have straw hats, for the sun is strong. We
drive between the sea, which makes a great noise, and the
mountains; the road is cut through a forest mostly of
fruit trees, the very creepers, which take the place of our
ivy, heavy with a great and delicious fruit, bigger than
your head and far nicer, called Barbedine. Presently we
came to a house in a pretty garden, quite by itself, very
nicely kept, the doors and windows open, no one about, and
no noise but that of the sea. It looked like a house in a
fairy-tale, and just beyond we must ford a river, and there
we saw the inhabitants. Just in the mouth of the river,
where it met the sea waves, they were ducking and bathing
and screaming together like a covey of birds: seven or
eight little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day
was long; and on the banks of the stream beside them,
real toys&mdash;toy ships, full rigged, and with their sails set,
though they were lying in the dust on their beam ends.
And then I knew for sure they were all children in a fairy-story,
living alone together in that lonely house with the
only toys in all the island; and that I had myself driven,
in my four-wheeled gig, into a corner of the fairy-story,
and the question was, should I get out again? But it was
all right; I guess only one of the wheels of the gig had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
got into the fairy-story; and the next jolt the whole thing
vanished, and we drove on in our sea-side forest as before,
and I have the honour to be Tomarcher&rsquo;s valued correspondent,
<span class="sc">Teriitera</span>, which he was previously known as</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">[Mrs. R. L. Stevenson to Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This letter from Mrs. Stevenson serves to fill out and explain
allusions in the three or four preceding. The beautiful brown
princess is Princess MoÃ«, ex-queen of Raiatea, well known to readers
of Pierre Loti and Miss Gordon Cumming. The move away from
Papeete, where Stevenson had fallen seriously ill, had been made in
hopes of finding on the island a climate that would suit him better.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Tautira, Tahiti, Dec. 4th</i> [1888].</p>

<p> <span class="scs">DEAR</span>, long neglected, though never forgotten Custodian,
I write you from fairyland, where we are living in a
fairy story, the guests of a beautiful brown princess. We
came to stay a week, five weeks have passed, and we are
still indefinite as to our time of leaving. It was chance
brought us here, for no one in Papeete could tell us a word
about this part of the island except that it was very fine
to look at, and inhabited by wild people&mdash;&ldquo;almost as wild
as the people of Anaho!&rdquo; That touch about the people
of Anaho inclined our hearts this way, so we finally concluded
to take a look at the other side of Tahiti. The place
of our landing was windy, uninhabited except by mosquitoes,
and Louis was ill. The first day Lloyd and the
Captain made an exploration, but came back disgusted.
They had found a Chinaman, a long way off, who seemed
to have some horses, but no desire to hire them to strangers,
and they had found nothing else whatever. The next
morning I took Valentine and went on a prospecting tour
of my own. I found the Chinaman, persuaded him to let
me have two horses and a wagon, and went back for the
rest of my family. When asked where I wished to go, I
could only say to the largest native village and the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
wild. Ill as Louis was, I brought him the next day, and
shall never cease to be thankful for my courage, for he has
gained health and strength every day. He takes sea baths
and swims, and lives almost entirely in the open air as
nearly without clothes as possible, a simple pyjama suit
of striped light flannel his only dress. As to shoes and
stockings we all have scorned them for months except
Mrs. Stevenson, who often goes barefoot and never, I
believe, wears stockings. Lloyd&rsquo;s costume, in which he
looks remarkably well, consists of a striped flannel shirt
and a pareu. The pareu is no more or less than a large
figured blue and white cotton window curtain twisted about
the waist, and hanging a little below the bare knees. Both
Louis and Lloyd wear wreaths of artificial flowers, made
of the dried pandanus leaf, on their hats.</p>

<p>MoÃ« has gone to Papeete by the command of the king,
whose letter was addressed &ldquo;To the great Princess at
Tautira. P.V.&rdquo; P.V. stands for PomarÃ© 5th. Every
evening, before she went, we played Van John lying in a
circle on pillows in the middle of the floor with our heads
together: and hardly an evening passed but it struck us
afresh how very much you would like MoÃ«, and we told
her of you again. The house (really here a palace) in
which we live, belongs to the sub-chief, Ori, a subject
and relation of the Princess. He, and his whole family,
consisting of his wife, his two little adopted sons, his
daughter and her two young babies, turned out to live in
a little bird-cage hut of one room. Ori is the very finest
specimen of a native we have seen yet; he is several inches
over six feet, of perfect though almost gigantic proportions,
and looks more like a Roman Emperor in bronze than
words can express. One day, when MoÃ« gave a feast, it
being the correct thing to do, we all wore wreaths of golden
yellow leaves on our heads; when Ori walked in and sat
down at the table, as with one voice we all cried out in
admiration. His manners and I might say his habit of
thought are English. In some ways, he is so like a Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
of the Guards that we often call him Colonel. It was
either the day before, or the morning of our public feast,
that Louis asked the Princess if she thought Ori would
accept his name. She was sure of it, and much pleased at
the idea. I wish you could have seen Louis, blushing like
a schoolgirl, when Ori came in, and the brotherhood was
offered. So now if you please, Louis is no more Louis,
having given that name away in the Tahitian form of
<i>Rui</i>, but is known as <i>Terii-Tera</i> (pronounced Ter<i>ee</i>terah)
that being Ori&rsquo;s Christian name. &ldquo;Ori a Ori&rdquo; is his clan
name.</p>

<p>Let me tell you of our village feast. The chief, who
was our guide in the matter, found four large fat hogs,
which Louis bought, and four cases of ship&rsquo;s biscuit were
sent over from the <i>Casco</i>, which is lying at Papeete for
repairs. Our feast cost in all about eighty dollars. Every
Sunday all things of public interest are announced in the
Farehau (an enormous public bird cage) and the news of
the week read aloud from the Papeete journal, if it happens
to turn up. Our feast was given on a Wednesday, and was
announced by the chief the Sunday before, who referred
to Louis as &ldquo;the rich one.&rdquo; Our hogs were killed in the
morning, washed in the sea, and roasted whole in a pit
with hot stones. When done they were laid on their
stomachs in neat open coffins of green basket work, each
hog with his case of biscuits beside him. Early in the
morning the entire population began bathing, a bath being
the preliminary to everything. At about three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;four
was the hour set&mdash;there was a general movement
towards our premises, so that I had to hurry Louis into his
clothes, all white, even to his shoes. Lloyd was also in
white, but barefoot. I was not prepared, so had to appear
in a red and white muslin gown, also barefoot. As Mrs.
Stevenson had had a feast of her own, conducted on
religious principles, she kept a little in the background, so
that her dress did not matter so much. The chief, who
speaks French very well, stood beside Louis to interpret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
for him. By the time we had taken our respective places
on the veranda in front of our door, an immense crowd
had assembled. They came in five, instead of four detachments
which was what the chief expected, and he was a
little confused at first, as he and Louis had been arranging
a speech to four sets of people, which ran in this order.
The clergyman at the head of the Protestants: the chief,
council, and irreligious:&mdash;one of the council at their head.
The schoolmaster with the schoolchildren: the catechist
and the Catholics: but there was another very small
sect, by some strange mischance called Mormons, which it
was supposed would be broken up and swallowed by the
others. But no, the Mormons came in a body alone,
marshalled by the best and wittiest speaker&mdash;<i>bar Rui</i>&mdash;in
Tautira. Each set of people came bending under the
weight of bamboo poles laden with fruits, pigs, fowls, etc.
All were dressed in their gayest pareus, and many had
wreaths of leaves or flowers on their heads. The prettiest
sight of all was the children, who came marching two and
two abreast, the bamboo poles lying lengthwise across
their shoulders.</p>

<p>When all the offerings had been piled in five great heaps
upon the ground, Louis made his oration to the accompaniment
of the squealing of pigs, the cackling of hens, and
the roar of the surf which beats man-high upon the roof.
A speech was made in return on behalf of the village, and
then each section sent forth its orator, the speeches following
in the order I have given above. Each speaker finished
by coming forward with one of the smaller things in his
hand, which he offered personally to Louis, and then shook
hands with us all and retired. Among these smaller presents
were many fish-hooks for large fishing, laboriously
carved from mother-of-pearl shell. One man came with
one egg in each hand saying, &ldquo;carry these to Scotland
with you, let them hatch into cocks, and their song shall
remind you of Tautira.&rdquo; The schoolmaster, with a leaf-basket
of rose apples, made his speech in French. Somehow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
the whole effect of the scene was like a story out of
the Bible, and I am not ashamed that Louis and I both
shed tears when we saw the enchanting procession of schoolchildren.
The Catholic priest, Father Bruno, a great friend
of ours, said that for the next fifty years the time of the
feast of the rich one will be talked of: which reminds me
of our friend Donat, of Fakarava, who was temporary
resident at the time we were there. &ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that the <i>Casco</i> came in just now, otherwise I should
be forgotten: but now the people will always say this or
that happened so long before&mdash;or so long after&mdash;the coming
of the <i>Silver Ship</i>, when Donat represented the government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In front of our house is a broad stretch of grass, dotted
with cocoanuts, breadfruits, mangoes, and the strange
pandanus tree. I wish you could have seen them, their
lower branches glowing with the rich colours of the fruits
hung upon them by Ori and his men, and great heaps
lying piled against their roots, on the evening of our feast.
From the bamboo poles that they were carried upon, a
pen was made for the ten pigs, and a fowl house for the
twenty-three fowls that were among the presents. But
there was a day of reckoning at hand. Time after time
we ran down to the beach to look for the <i>Casco</i>, until we
were in despair. For over a month we had lived in Ori&rsquo;s
house, causing him infinite trouble and annoyance, and
not even his, at that. Areia (the chief&mdash;Areia means the
Prince) went to Papeete and came back with a letter to
say that more work had to be done upon the <i>Casco</i>, and
it might be any time before she could get to Tautira. We
had used up all our stores, and had only a few dollars of
money left in Tautira, and not very much in Papeete.
Could we stand the journey to Papeete, we could not live
upon the yacht in the midst of the workmen, and we had
not money enough left to live at an hotel. We were playing
cards on the floor, as usual, when this message came,
and you can imagine its effect. I knew perfectly well that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
Rui would force us to stay on with him, but what depressed
me the most of all, was the fact of Louis having made
brothers with him just before this took place. Had there
been a shadow of doubt on our dear Rui&rsquo;s face, I should
have fled from before him. Sitting there on the floor waiting
for him was too much for my nerves and I burst into
tears, upon which the princess wept bitterly. In the meantime
the priest had dropped in, so that we had him and
MoÃ«, and Areia, as witnesses to our humiliating position.
First came Madame Rui, who heard the story, and sat down
on the floor in silence, which was very damping for a
beginning, and then Ori of Ori, the magnificent, who listened
to the tale of the shipwrecked mariners with serious dignity,
asking one or two questions, and then spoke to this effect.
&ldquo;You are my brother: all that I have is yours. I know
that your food is done, but I can give you plenty of fish
and taro. We like you, and wish to have you here. Stay
where you are till the <i>Casco</i> comes. Be happy&mdash;<i>et ne
pleurez pas</i>.&rdquo; Louis dropped his head into his hands and
wept, and then we all went up to Rui and shook hands
with him and accepted his offer. Madame Rui, who had
been silent only as a dutiful wife, that her husband might
speak first, poured forth manifold reasons for our staying
on as long as we could possibly manage. During all this
scene, an attendant of the princess had been sitting on the
floor behind us, a baby in his arms, where he had ensconced
himself for the purpose of watching the game. He understood
nothing of what was going on; we wondered afterwards
what he thought of it. Reduced as we were, we still
had a few bottles of champagne left. Champagne being
an especial weakness of our gigantic friend, it occurred to
some one that this was a proper occasion to open a couple
of bottles. Louis, the Princess, and I were quite, as the
Scotch so well say, &ldquo;begrutten,&rdquo; Areia&rsquo;s immense eyes were
fairly melting out of his head with emotion, the priest was
wiping his eyes and blowing his nose: and then for no
apparent cause we suddenly fell to drinking and clinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
glasses quite merrily: the bewildered attendant clinked
and drank too, and then sat down and waited in case there
should be any repetition of the drinking part of the performance.
And sure enough there was, for in the midst
of an animated discussion as to ways and means, Mrs.
Stevenson announced that it was St. Andrew&rsquo;s day, so
again the attendant clinked and drank with Ori&rsquo;s mad
foreigners.</p>

<p>It is quite true that we live almost entirely upon native
food; our luncheon to-day consisted of raw fish with
sauce made of cocoanut milk mixed with sea water and
lime juice, taro poi-poi, and bananas roasted in hot stones
in a little pit in the ground, with cocoanut cream to eat
with them. Still we like coffee in the evening, a little wine
at dinner, and a few other products of civilisation. It
would be possible, the chief said, to send a boat, but that
would cost sixty dollars. A final arrangement, which we
were forced to accept, was that Rui should go in his own
boat, and the chief would appoint a substitute for some
public work that he was then engaged upon. Early the
next morning, amidst a raging sea and a storming wind,
Rui departed with three men to help him. It is forty miles
to Papeete, and Rui, starting in the early morning, arrived
there at nine o&rsquo;clock; but alas, the wind was against
him, and it was altogether six days before he got back.</p>

<p>Louis has done a great deal of work on his new story,
<i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>, almost finished it in fact, while
Mrs. Stevenson and I are deep in the mysteries of hatmaking,
which is a ladies&rsquo; accomplishment taking the place
of water-colour drawing in England. It is a small compliment
to present a hat to an acquaintance. Altogether
we have about thirteen. Next door to us is Areia&rsquo;s out-of-door
house, where he and the ladies of his family sleep
and eat: it has a thatched roof of palm branches, and a
floor of boards, the sides and ends being open to the world.
On the floor are spread mats plaited of pandanus leaves,
and pillows stuffed with silk cotton from the cotton tree.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
We make little calls upon the ladies, lie upon the mats,
and smoke cigarettes made of tobacco leaves rolled in a
bit of dried pandanus, and admire their work, or get a
lesson; or they call upon us, and lie upon our mats. One
day there was an election in the Farehau. It takes place
all over the island once a year, and among others, the
sub-chief and head-councillor is chosen. For the latter,
our Rui was a candidate. In the beginning, the French
deposed the born chiefs and told the people to elect
men for themselves. The choice of Tautira fell upon
Rui, who declined the honour, saying that Areia was
his natural chief, and he could not take a position that
should belong to his superior; upon which the people
elected Areia chief, and Rui sub-chief and head-councillor.
We all went over to the Farehau, where Areia sat in the
middle of his councillors on a dais behind a long table.
The Farehau is an immense bird-cage of bamboos tied
together with pandanus fibre, and thatched with palms.
In front of the dais the ground is deeply covered with
dried leaves. The costume of the dignitaries was rather
odd. Areia wore a white shirt and blue flannel coat, which
was well enough; but on his plump legs were a pair of the
most incredible trousers: light blue calico with a small red
pattern, such as servant girls wear for gowns in England:
on his feet were neat little shoes and stockings. Rui was
a fine sight, and we were very proud of him; he sat,
exactly like an English gentleman, holding himself well in
hand, alert as a fox and keen as a greyhound: several men
spoke from the farther end of the hall, making objections
of some sort, we could see. Rui listened with a half satirical,
half kindly smile in his eyes, and then dropped a quiet
answer without rising from his seat, which had the effect
of raising a shout of laughter, and quite demolishing his
opponent. Voters came up to the table and dropped their
bits of paper into a slit in a box: some led children by the
hand, and some carried babies in their arms; across the
centre of the great room children and dogs ran chasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
each other and playing. I noticed two little maids who
walked up and down for a long time with their arms intertwined
about each other&rsquo;s waists. Near where we sat (we
were on the dais, above the common herd), a pretty young
lady having tied up her dog&rsquo;s mouth with a tuft of grass,
industriously caught and cracked fleas from its back.
Both Lloyd and I grew very sleepy, and as we did not like
to leave till the election was decided, we just threw ourselves
down and took a nap at the feet of the councillors:
nor did we wake till the chief called out to us in English
&ldquo;it is finished.&rdquo; I never thought I should be able to
calmly sleep at a public meeting on a platform in the face
of several hundred people: but it is wonderful how quickly
one takes up the ways of a people when you live with
them as intimately as we do.</p>

<p>I hear dinner coming on the table, so with much love
from us all to you and other dear ones, including our
dear friend Henry James, believe me, affectionately yours,</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Yacht Casco, at Sea, 14th January</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Twenty days out from Papeete.
Yes, sir, all that, and only (for a guess) in 4Â° north or at
the best 4Â°30&rsquo;, though already the wind seems to smell
a little of the North Pole. My handwriting you must take
as you get, for we are speeding along through a nasty
swell, and I can only keep my place at the table by means
of a foot against the divan, the unoccupied hand meanwhile
gripping the ink-bottle. As we begin (so very slowly)
to draw near to seven months of correspondence, we are
all in some fear; and I want to have letters written before
I shall be plunged into that boiling pot of disagreeables
which I constantly expect at Honolulu. What is needful
can be added there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span></p>

<p>We were kept two months at Tautira in the house of
my dear old friend, Ori a Ori, till both the masts of this
invaluable yacht had been repaired. It was all for the
best: Tautira being the most beautiful spot, and its people
the most amiable, I have ever found. Besides which, the
climate suited me to the ground; I actually went sea-bathing
almost every day, and in our feasts (we are all
huge eaters in Taiarapu) have been known to apply four
times for pig. And then again I got wonderful materials
for my book, collected songs and legends on the spot;
songs still sung in chorus by perhaps a hundred persons,
not two of whom can agree on their translation; legends,
on which I have seen half a dozen seniors sitting in conclave
and debating what came next. Once I went a day&rsquo;s
journey to the other side of the island to Tati, the high
chief of the Tevas&mdash;<i>my</i> chief that is, for I am now a Teva
and Teriitera, at your service&mdash;to collect more and correct
what I had already. In the meanwhile I got on with my
work, almost finished <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>, which
contains more human work than anything of mine but
<i>Kidnapped</i>, and wrote the half of another ballad, the
<i>Song of Rahero</i>, on a Taiarapu legend of my own clan, sir&mdash;not
so much fire as the <i>Feast of Famine</i>, but promising
to be more even and correct. But the best fortune of our
stay at Tautira was my knowledge of Ori himself, one
of the finest creatures extant. The day of our parting
was a sad one. We deduced from it a rule for travellers:
not to stay two months in one place&mdash;which is to cultivate
regrets.</p>

<p>At last our contemptible ship was ready; to sea we
went, bound for Honolulu and the letter-bag, on Christmas
Day; and from then to now have experienced every
sort of minor misfortune, squalls, calms, contrary winds
and seas, pertinacious rains, declining stores, till we came
almost to regard ourselves as in the case of Vanderdecken.
Three days ago our luck seemed to improve, we struck a
leading breeze, got creditably through the doldrums, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
just as we looked to have the N.E. trades and a straight
run, the rains and squalls and calms began again about
midnight, and this morning, though there is breeze enough
to send us along, we are beaten back by an obnoxious swell
out of the north. Here is a page of complaint, when a
verse of thanksgiving had perhaps been more in place. For
all this time we must have been skirting past dangerous
weather, in the tail and circumference of hurricanes, and
getting only annoyance where we should have had peril,
and ill-humour instead of fear.</p>

<p>I wonder if I have managed to give you any news this
time, or whether the usual damn hangs over my letter?
&ldquo;The midwife whispered, Be thou dull!&rdquo; or at least
inexplicit. Anyway I have tried my best, am exhausted
with the effort, and fall back into the land of generalities.
I cannot tell you how often we have planned our arrival
at the Monument: two nights ago, the 12th January, we
had it all planned out, arrived in the lights and whirl of
Waterloo, hailed a hansom, span up Waterloo Road, over
the bridge, etc. etc., and hailed the Monument gate in
triumph and with indescribable delight. My dear Custodian,
I always think we are too sparing of assurances:
Cordelia is only to be excused by Regan and Goneril in the
same nursery; I wish to tell you that the longer I live,
the more dear do you become to me; nor does my heart
own any stronger sentiment. If the bloody schooner didn&rsquo;t
send me flying in every sort of direction at the same time,
I would say better what I feel so much; but really, if you
were here, you would not be writing letters, I believe;
and even I, though of a more marine constitution, am much
perturbed by this bobbery and wish&mdash;O ye Gods, how I
wish!&mdash;that it was done, and we had arrived, and I had
Pandora&rsquo;s Box (my mail-bag) in hand, and was in the lively
hope of something eatable for dinner instead of salt horse,
tinned mutton, duff without any plums, and pie fruit,
which now make up our whole repertory. O Pandora&rsquo;s
Box! I wonder what you will contain. As like as not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
you will contain but little money: if that be so, we shall
have to retire to &rsquo;Frisco in the <i>Casco</i>, and thence by sea
<i>via</i> Panama to Southampton, where we should arrive in
April. I would like fine to see you on the tug: ten years
older both of us than the last time you came to welcome
Fanny and me to England. If we have money, however,
we shall do a little differently: send the <i>Casco</i> away from
Honolulu empty of its high-born lessees, for that voyage
to &rsquo;Frisco is one long dead beat in foul and at last in cold
weather; stay awhile behind, follow by steamer, cross the
States by train, stay awhile in New York on business, and
arrive probably by the German Line in Southampton.
But all this is a question of money. We shall have to lie
very dark awhile to recruit our finances: what comes from
the book of the cruise, I do not want to touch until the
capital is repaid.</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To E. L. Burlingame</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, January</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;Here at last I have arrived.
We could not get away from Tahiti till Christmas Day,
and then had thirty days of calms and squalls, a deplorable
passage. This has thrown me all out of gear in every
way. I plunge into business.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Master.</i> Herewith go three more parts. You
see he grows in bulk; this making ten already, and I am
not yet sure if I can finish it in an eleventh; which shall
go to you <i>quam primum</i>&mdash;I hope by next mail.</p>

<p>2. <i>Illustrations to M.</i> I totally forgot to try to write
to Hole. It was just as well, for I find it impossible to
forecast with sufficient precision. You had better throw
off all this and let him have it at once. <i>Please do: all, and
at once: see further;</i> and I should hope he would still be
in time for the later numbers. The three pictures I have
received are so truly good that I should bitterly regret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
having the volume imperfectly equipped. They are the
best illustrations I have seen since I don&rsquo;t know when.</p>

<p>3. <i>Money.</i> To-morrow the mail comes in, and I hope
it will bring me money either from you or home, but I
will add a word on that point.</p>

<p>4. My address will be Honolulu&mdash;no longer Yacht
<i>Casco</i>, which I am packing off&mdash;till probably April.</p>

<p>5. As soon as I am through with <i>The Master</i>, I shall
finish <i>The Game of Bluff</i>&mdash;now rechristened <i>The Wrong
Box</i>. This I wish to sell, cash down. It is of course
copyright in the States; and I offer it to you for five
thousand dollars. Please reply on this by return. Also
please tell the typewriter who was so good as to be amused
by our follies that I am filled with admiration for his piece
of work.</p>

<p>6. <i>Master</i> again. Please see that I haven&rsquo;t the name
of the Governor of New York wrong (1764 is the date) in
part ten. I have no book of reference to put me right.
Observe you now have up to August inclusive in hand, so
you should begin to feel happy.</p>

<p>Is this all? I wonder, and fear not. Henry the Trader
has not yet turned up: I hope he may to-morrow, when
we expect a mail. Not one word of business have I received
either from the States or England, nor anything in the
shape of coin; which leaves me in a fine uncertainty and
quite penniless on these islands. H.M.<a name="FnAnchor_27" id="FnAnchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> (who is a gentleman
of a courtly order and much tinctured with letters)
is very polite; I may possibly ask for the position of
palace doorkeeper. My voyage has been a singular mixture
of good and ill fortune. As far as regards interest
and material, the fortune has been admirable; as far as
regards time, money, and impediments of all kinds, from
squalls and calms to rotten masts and sprung spars, simply
detestable. I hope you will be interested to hear of two
volumes on the wing. The cruise itself, you are to know,
will make a big volume with appendices; some of it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
first appear as (what they call) letters in some of M&rsquo;Clure&rsquo;s
papers. I believe the book when ready will have a fair
measure of serious interest: I have had great fortune in
finding old songs and ballads and stories, for instance,
and have many singular instances of life in the last few
years among these islands.</p>

<p>The second volume is of ballads. You know <i>Ticonderoga</i>.
I have written another: <i>The Feast of Famine</i>, a
Marquesan story. A third is half done: <i>The Song of
Rahero</i>, a genuine Tahitian legend. A fourth dances before,
me. A Hawaiian fellow this, <i>The Priest&rsquo;s Drought</i>, or
some such name. If, as I half suspect, I get enough subjects
out of the islands, <i>Ticonderoga</i> shall be suppressed,
and we&rsquo;ll call the volume <i>South Sea Ballads</i>. In health,
spirits, renewed interest in life, and, I do believe, refreshed
capacity for work, the cruise has proved a wise folly. Still
we&rsquo;re not home, and (although the friend of a crowned
head) are penniless upon these (as one of my correspondents
used to call them) &ldquo;lovely but <i>fatil</i> islands.&rdquo; By the
way, who wrote the <i>Lion of the Nile</i>? My dear sir, that
is Something Like. Overdone in bits, it has a true thought
and a true ring of language. Beg the anonymous from
me, to delete (when he shall republish) the two last verses,
and end on &ldquo;the lion of the Nile.&rdquo; One Lampman has a
good sonnet on a &ldquo;Winter Evening&rdquo; in, I think, the same
number: he seems ill named, but I am tempted to hope
a man is not always answerable for his name.<a name="FnAnchor_28" id="FnAnchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> For
instance, you would think you knew mine. No such matter.
It is&mdash;at your service and Mr. Scribner&rsquo;s and that of all
of the faithful&mdash;Teriitera (pray pronounce Tayree-Tayra)
or (<i>gallicÃ©</i>) TÃ©ri-tÃ©ra.</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p>More when the mail shall come.</p>

<p class="pt2">I am an idiot. I want to be clear on one point. Some
of Hole&rsquo;s drawings must of course be too late; and yet
they seem to me so excellent I would fain have the lot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
complete. It is one thing for you to pay for drawings
which are to appear in that soul-swallowing machine, your
magazine: quite another if they are only to illustrate a
volume. I wish you to take a brisk (even a fiery) decision
on the point; and let Hole know. To resume my desultory
song, I desire you would carry the same fire (hereinbefore
suggested) into your decision on <i>The Wrong Box</i>; for in
my present state of benighted ignorance as to my affairs
for the last seven months&mdash;I know not even whether my
house or my mother&rsquo;s house have been let&mdash;I desire to see
something definite in front of me&mdash;outside the lot of palace
doorkeeper. I believe the said <i>Wrong Box</i> is a real lark;
in which, of course, I may be grievously deceived; but
the typewriter is with me. I may also be deceived as
to the numbers of <i>The Master</i> now going and already gone;
but to me they seem First Chop, sir, First Chop. I hope
I shall pull off that damned ending; but it still depresses
me: this is your doing, Mr. Burlingame: you would have
it there and then, and I fear it&mdash;I fear that ending.</p>

<p class="to">To Charles Baxter</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, February 8th,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;Here we are at Honolulu, and
have dismissed the yacht, and lie here till April anyway,
in a fine state of haze, which I am yet in hopes some letter
of yours (still on the way) may dissipate. No money,
and not one word as to money! However, I have got
the yacht paid off in triumph, I think; and though we
stay here impignorate, it should not be for long, even if
you bring us no extra help from home. The cruise has
been a great success, both as to matter, fun, and health;
and yet, Lord, man! we&rsquo;re pleased to be ashore! Yon was
a very fine voyage from Tahiti up here, but&mdash;the dry land&rsquo;s
a fine place too, and we don&rsquo;t mind squalls any longer, and
eh, man, that&rsquo;s a great thing. Blow, blow, thou wintry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
wind, thou hast done me no appreciable harm beyond a
few grey hairs! Altogether, this foolhardy venture is
achieved; and if I have but nine months of life and any
kind of health, I shall have both eaten my cake and got it
back again with usury. But, man, there have been days
when I felt guilty, and thought I was in no position for
the head of a house.</p>

<p>Your letter and accounts are doubtless at S. F., and
will reach me in course. My wife is no great shakes; she
is the one who has suffered most. My mother has had
a Huge Old Time; Lloyd is first chop; I so well that I
do not know myself&mdash;sea-bathing, if you please, and what
is far more dangerous, entertaining and being entertained
by His Majesty here, who is a very fine intelligent fellow,
but O, Charles! what a crop for the drink! He carries
it, too, like a mountain with a sparrow on its shoulders.
We calculated five bottles of champagne in three hours
and a half (afternoon), and the sovereign quite presentable,
although perceptibly more dignified at the end....</p>

<p>The extraordinary health I enjoy and variety of interests
I find among these islands would tempt me to remain
here; only for Lloyd, who is not well placed in such
countries for a permanency; and a little for Colvin, to
whom I feel I owe a sort of filial duty. And these two
considerations will no doubt bring me back&mdash;to go to bed
again&mdash;in England.&mdash;Yours ever affectionately,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To R. A. M. Stevenson</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands,
February</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BOB</span>,&mdash;My extremely foolhardy venture is
practically over. How foolhardy it was I don&rsquo;t think
I realised. We had a very small schooner, and, like most
yachts, over-rigged and over-sparred, and like many
American yachts on a very dangerous sail plan. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
waters we sailed in are, of course, entirely unlighted, and
very badly charted; in the Dangerous Archipelago,
through which we were fools enough to go, we were perfectly
in ignorance of where we were for a whole night
and half the next day, and this in the midst of invisible
islands and rapid and variable currents; and we were
lucky when we found our whereabouts at last. We have
twice had all we wanted in the way of squalls: once, as
I came on deck, I found the green sea over the cockpit
coamings and running down the companion like a brook
to meet me; at that same moment the foresail sheet
jammed and the captain had no knife; this was the only
occasion on the cruise that ever I set a hand to a rope,
but I worked like a Trojan, judging the possibility of
hemorrhage better than the certainty of drowning. Another
time I saw a rather singular thing: our whole ship&rsquo;s company
as pale as paper from the captain to the cook; we
had a black squall astern on the port side and a white
squall ahead to starboard; the complication passed off
innocuous, the black squall only fetching us with its tail,
and the white one slewing off somewhere else. Twice we
were a long while (days) in the close vicinity of hurricane
weather, but again luck prevailed, and we saw none of it.
These are dangers incident to these seas and small craft.
What was an amazement, and at the same time a powerful
stroke of luck, both our masts were rotten, and we found
it out&mdash;I was going to say in time, but it was stranger and
luckier than that. The head of the mainmast hung over
so that hands were afraid to go to the helm; and less than
three weeks before&mdash;I am not sure it was more than a
fortnight&mdash;we had been nearly twelve hours beating off
the lee shore of Eimeo (or Moorea, next island to Tahiti)
in half a gale of wind with a violent head sea: she would
neither tack nor wear once, and had to be boxed off with
the mainsail&mdash;you can imagine what an ungodly show of
kites we carried&mdash;and yet the mast stood. The very day
after that, in the southern bight of Tahiti, we had a near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
squeak, the wind suddenly coming calm; the reefs were
close in with, my eye! what a surf! The pilot thought
we were gone, and the captain had a boat cleared, when
a lucky squall came to our rescue. My wife, hearing the
order given about the boats, remarked to my mother,
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that nice? We shall soon be ashore!&rdquo; Thus
does the female mind unconsciously skirt along the verge
of eternity. Our voyage up here was most disastrous&mdash;calms,
squalls, head sea, waterspouts of rain, hurricane
weather all about, and we in the midst of the hurricane
season, when even the hopeful builder and owner of the
yacht had pronounced these seas unfit for her. We ran
out of food, and were quite given up for lost in Honolulu:
people had ceased to speak to Belle<a name="FnAnchor_29" id="FnAnchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> about the <i>Casco</i>, as
a deadly subject.</p>

<p>But the perils of the deep were part of the programme;
and though I am very glad to be done with them for a
while and comfortably ashore, where a squall does not
matter a snuff to any one, I feel pretty sure I shall want
to get to sea again ere long. The dreadful risk I took
was financial, and double-headed. First, I had to sink a
lot of money in the cruise, and if I didn&rsquo;t get health, how
was I to get it back? I have got health to a wonderful
extent; and as I have the most interesting matter for
my book, bar accidents, I ought to get all I have laid out
and a profit. But, second (what I own I never considered
till too late), there was the danger of collisions, of damages
and heavy repairs, of disablement, towing, and salvage;
indeed, the cruise might have turned round and cost me
double. Nor will this danger be quite over till I hear
the yacht is in San Francisco; for though I have shaken
the dust of her deck from my feet, I fear (as a point of
law) she is still mine till she gets there.</p>

<p>From my point of view, up to now the cruise has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
a wonderful success. I never knew the world was so
amusing. On the last voyage we had grown so used to
sea-life that no one wearied, though it lasted a full month,
except Fanny, who is always ill. All the time our visits
to the islands have been more like dreams than realities:
the people, the life, the beachcombers, the old stories and
songs I have picked up, so interesting; the climate, the
scenery, and (in some places) the women, so beautiful.
The women are handsomest in Tahiti, the men in the
Marquesas; both as fine types as can be imagined. Lloyd
reminds me, I have not told you one characteristic incident
of the cruise from a semi-naval point of view. One night
we were going ashore in Anaho Bay; the most awful
noise on deck; the breakers distinctly audible in the
cabin; and there I had to sit below, entertaining in my
best style a negroid native chieftain, much the worse for
rum! You can imagine the evening&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>

<p>This naval report on cruising in the South Seas would
be incomplete without one other trait. On our voyage up
here I came one day into the dining-room, the hatch in
the floor was open, the ship&rsquo;s boy was below with a baler,
and two of the hands were carrying buckets as for a fire;
this meant that the pumps had ceased working.</p>

<p>One stirring day was that in which we sighted Hawaii.
It blew fair, but very strong; we carried jib, foresail, and
mainsail, all single-reefed, and she carried her lee rail under
water and flew. The swell, the heaviest I have ever been
out in&mdash;I tried in vain to estimate the height, <i>at least</i>
fifteen feet&mdash;came tearing after us about a point and a
half off the wind. We had the best hand&mdash;old Louis&mdash;at
the wheel; and, really, he did nobly, and had noble luck,
for it never caught us once. At times it seemed we must
have it; old Louis would look over his shoulder with the
queerest look and dive down his neck into his shoulders;
and then it missed us somehow, and only sprays came over
our quarter, turning the little outside lane of deck into a
mill race as deep as to the cockpit coamings. I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
remember anything more delightful and exciting. Pretty
soon after we were lying absolutely becalmed under the
lee of Hawaii, of which we had been warned; and the
captain never confessed he had done it on purpose, but
when accused, he smiled. Really, I suppose he did quite
right, for we stood committed to a dangerous race, and to
bring her to the wind would have been rather a heart-sickening
man&oelig;uvre.</p>

you will see we have got out of this adventure&mdash;or hope to
have&mdash;with wonderful fortune. I have the retrospective
horrors on me when I think of the liabilities I incurred;
but, thank God, I think I&rsquo;m in port again, and I have
found one climate in which I can enjoy life. Even Honolulu
is too cold for me; but the south isles were a heaven
upon earth to a puir, catarrhal party like Johns&rsquo;one. We
think, as Tahiti is too complete a banishment, to try
Madeira. It&rsquo;s only a week from England, good communications,

split over writing it. Since I have been here, I have been
toiling like a galley slave: three numbers of <i>The Master</i>
to rewrite, five chapters of <i>The Wrong Box</i> to write and
rewrite, and about five hundred lines of a narrative poem
to write, rewrite, and re-rewrite. Now I have <i>The Master</i>
waiting me for its continuation, two numbers more; when
that&rsquo;s done, I shall breathe. This spasm of activity has

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Still not a word from you! I am
utterly cast down; but I will try to return good for evil
and for once give you news. We are here in the suburb
of Honolulu in a rambling house or set of houses in a
great garden.</p>

<p>1. Lloyd&rsquo;s room. 2. My mother&rsquo;s room. 3. A room kept
dark for photographs. 4. The kitchen. 5. Balcony. 6.
The Lanai, an open room or summer parlour, partly surrounded
with Venetian shutters, in part quite open, which
is the living-room. 7. A crazy dirty cottage used for the
arts. 8. Another crazy dirty cottage, where Fanny and
I live. The town is some three miles away, but the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
is connected by telephone with the chief shops, and the
tramway runs to within a quarter of a mile of us. I find
Honolulu a beastly climate after Tahiti and have been in
bed a little; but my colds <i>took on no catarrhal symptom</i>,
which is staggeringly delightful. I am studying Hawaiian
with a native, a Mr. Joseph Poepoe, a clever fellow too:
the tongue is a little bewildering; I am reading a pretty
story in native&mdash;no, really it is pretty, although wandering
and wordy; highly pretty with its continual traffic from
one isle to another of the soothsayer, pursuing rainbows.
Fanny is, I think, a good deal better on the whole, having
profited like me by the tropics; my mother and Lloyd
are first-rate. I do not think I have heard from you
since last May; certainly not since June; and this really
frightens me. Do write, even now. Scribner&rsquo;s Sons it
should be; we shall probably be out of this some time in
April, home some time in June. But the world whirls
to me perceptibly, a mass of times and seasons and places
and engagements, and seas to cross, and continents to
traverse, so that I scarce know where I am. Well, I have
had a brave time. <i>Et ego in Arcadia</i>&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t
believe Arcadia was a spot upon Tahiti. I have written
another long narrative poem: the <i>Song of Rahero</i>.
Privately, I think it good: but your ominous silence over
the <i>Feast of Famine</i> leads me to fear we shall not be agreed.
Is it possible I have wounded you in some way? I scarce
like to dream that it is possible; and yet I know too well
it may be so. If so, don&rsquo;t write, and you can pitch into
me when we meet. I am, admittedly, as mild as London
Stout now; and the Old Man Virulent much a creature
of the past. My dear Colvin, I owe you and Fleeming
Jenkin, the two older men who took the trouble and knew
how to make a friend of me, everything that I have or am:
if I have behaved ill, just hold on and give me a chance,
you shall have the slanging of me and I bet I shall prefer
it to this silence.&mdash;Ever, my dear Colvin, your most
affectionate</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This letter brought to friends in England the first news of the
intended prolongation of the cruise among the remoter islands of the
Pacific.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, towards the end of March</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;Louis has improved so wonderfully
in the delicious islands of the South Seas, that we think
of trying yet one more voyage. We are a little uncertain
as to how we shall go, whether in a missionary ship, or by
hiring schooners from point to point, but the &ldquo;unregenerate&rdquo;
islands we must see. I suppose we shall be off some
time in June, which will fetch us back to England in
another year&rsquo;s time. You could hardly believe it if you
could see Louis now. He looks as well as he ever did in
his life, and has had no sign of cough or hemorrhage (begging
pardon of Nemesis) for many months. It seems a
pity to return to England until his health is firmly reestablished,
and also a pity not to see all that we can see
quite easily starting from this place: and which will be
our only opportunity in life. Of course there is the usual
risk from hostile natives, and the horrible sea, but a positive
risk is so much more wholesome than a negative one,
and it is all such joy to Louis and Lloyd. As for me, I
hate the sea, and am afraid of it (though no one will believe
that because in time of danger I do not make an outcry&mdash;nevertheless
I <i>am</i> afraid of it, and it is not kind to me),
but I love the tropic weather, and the wild people, and
to see my two boys so happy. Mrs. Stevenson is going
back to Scotland in May, as she does not like to be longer
away from her old sister, who has been very ill. And
besides, we do not feel justified in taking her to the sort
of places we intend to visit. As for me, I can get comfort
out of very rough surroundings for my people, I can
work hard and enjoy it; I can even shoot pretty well,
and though I &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want to fight, by jingo if I must,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
why I can. I don&rsquo;t suppose there will be any occasion
for that sort of thing&mdash;only in case.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure of the names, but I <i>think</i> our new
cruise includes the Gilberts, the Fijis, and the Solomons.
A letter might go from the Fijis; Louis will write the
particulars, of which I am not sure. As for myself, I
have had more cares than I was really fit for. To keep
house on a yacht is no easy thing. When Louis and I
broke loose from the ship and lived alone amongst the
natives I got on very well. It was when I was deathly
sea-sick, and the question was put to me by the cook,
&ldquo;What shall we have for the cabin dinner, what for to-morrow&rsquo;s
breakfast, what for lunch? and what about the
sailors&rsquo; food? Please come and look at the biscuits, for
the weevils have got into them, and show me how to make
yeast that will rise of itself, and smell the pork which seems
pretty high, and give me directions about making a pudding
with molasses&mdash;and what is to be done about the bugs?&rdquo;&mdash;etc.
etc. In the midst of heavy dangerous weather,
when I was lying on the floor clutching a basin, down comes
the mate with a cracked head, and I must needs cut off
the hair matted with blood, wash and dress the wound,
and administer restoratives. I do not like being &ldquo;the
lady of the yacht,&rdquo; but ashore! O, then I felt I was repaid
for all. I wonder did any of my letters from beautiful
Tautira ever come to hand, with the descriptions of our
life with Louis&rsquo;s adopted brother Ori a Ori? Ori wrote
to us, if no one else did, and I mean to give you a translation
of his letter. It begins with our native names.</p>


<p class="rt pt2"><i>Tautira, 26 Dec. 1888.</i></p>

<p>To Teriitera (Louis) and Tapina Tutu (myself) and
Aromaiterai (Lloyd) and Teiriha (Mrs. Stevenson) Salutation
in the true Jesus.</p>

<p>I make you to know my great affection. At the hour
when you left us, I was filled with tears; my wife, Rui
Tehini, also, and all of my household. When you embarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
I felt a great sorrow. It is for this that I went upon the
road, and you looked from that ship, and I looked at you
on the ship with great grief until you had raised the anchor
and hoisted the sails. When the ship started, I ran along
the beach to see you still; and when you were on the
open sea I cried out to you, &ldquo;farewell Louis&rdquo;: and when
I was coming back to my house I seemed to hear your
voice crying &ldquo;Rui farewell.&rdquo; Afterwards I watched the
ship as long as I could until the night fell; and when it
was dark I said to myself, &ldquo;if I had wings I should fly to
the ship to meet you, and to sleep amongst you, so that I
might be able to come back to shore and to tell Rui Tehini,
&rsquo;I have slept upon the ship of Teriitera.&rsquo;&rdquo; After that we
passed that night in the impatience of grief. Towards
eight o&rsquo;clock I seemed to hear your voice, &ldquo;Teriitera&mdash;Rui&mdash;here
is the hour for putter and tiro&rdquo; (cheese and syrup).
I did not sleep that night, thinking continually of you, my
very dear friend, until the morning: being then awake I
went to see Tapina Tutu on her bed, and alas, she was not
there. Afterwards I looked into your rooms; they did
not please me as they used to do. I did not hear your
voice crying, &ldquo;hail Rui.&rdquo; I thought then that you had
gone, and that you had left me. Rising up I went to the
beach to see your ship, and I could not see it. I wept,
then, till the night, telling myself continually, &ldquo;Teriitera
returns into his own country and leaves his dear Rui in
grief, so that I suffer for him, and weep for him.&rdquo; I will
not forget you in my memory. Here is the thought: I
desire to meet you again. It is my dear Teriitera makes
the only riches I desire in this world. It is your eyes that
I desire to see again. It must be that your body and my
body shall eat together at our table: there is what would
make my heart content. But now we are separated. May
God be with you all. May His word and His mercy go
with you, so that you may be well and we also, according
to the words of Paul.</p>

<p class="rt"><span class="sc">Ori a Ori</span>; that is to say, <span class="sc">Rui</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span></p>

<p class="pt1">After reading this to me Louis has left in tears saying
that he is not worthy that such a letter should be written
to him. We hope to so manage that we shall stop at
Tahiti and see Rui once more. I tell myself that pleasant
story when I wake in the night.</p>

<p>I find my head swimming so that I cannot write any
more. I wish some rich Catholic would send a parlour
organ to PÃ¨re Bruno of Tautira. I am going to try and
save money to do it myself, but he may die before I have
enough. I feel ashamed to be sitting here when I think
of that old man who cannot draw because of scrivener&rsquo;s
paralysis, who has no one year in and year out to speak
to but natives (our Rui is a Protestant not bigoted like the
rest of them&mdash;but still a Protestant) and the only pastime
he has is playing on an old broken parlour organ whose
keys are mostly dumb. I know no more pathetic figure.
Have you no rich Catholic friends who would send him
an organ that he could play upon? Of course I am talking
nonsense, and yet I know somewhere that person exists
if only I knew the place.</p>

<p>Our dearest love to you all.</p>

<p class="to">To Henry James</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu</i> [<i>March</i> 1889].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR JAMES</span>,&mdash;Yes&mdash;I own up&mdash;I am untrue to
friendship and (what is less, but still considerable) to
civilisation. I am not coming home for another year.
There it is, cold and bald, and now you won&rsquo;t believe in
me at all, and serve me right (says you) and the devil take
me. But look here, and judge me tenderly. I have had
more fun and pleasure of my life these past months than
ever before, and more health than any time in ten long
years. And even here in Honolulu I have withered in the
cold; and this precious deep is filled with islands, which
we may still visit; and though the sea is a deathful place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
I like to be there, and like squalls (when they are over);
and to draw near to a new island, I cannot say how much
I like. In short, I take another year of this sort of life,
and mean to try to work down among the poisoned arrows,
and mean (if it may be) to come back again when the
thing is through, and converse with Henry James as heretofore;
and in the meanwhile issue directions to H. J. to
write to me once more. Let him address here at Honolulu,
for my views are vague; and if it is sent here it will follow
and find me, if I am to be found; and if I am not to be
found, the man James will have done his duty, and we shall
be at the bottom of the sea, where no post-office clerk
can be expected to discover us, or languishing on a coral
island, the philosophic drudges of some barbarian potentate:
perchance, of an American Missionary. My wife
has just sent to Mrs. Sitwell a translation (<i>tant bien que
mal</i>) of a letter I have had from my chief friend in this
part of the world: go and see her, and get a hearing of
it; it will do you good; it is a better method of correspondence
than even Henry James&rsquo;s. I jest, but seriously
it is a strange thing for a tough, sick, middle-aged scrivener
like R. L. S. to receive a letter so conceived from a man
fifty years old, a leading politician, a crack orator, and
the great wit of his village: boldly say, &ldquo;the highly popular
M.P. of Tautira.&rdquo; My nineteenth century strikes here,
and lies alongside of something beautiful and ancient.
I think the receipt of such a letter might humble, shall I
say even &mdash;&mdash;? and for me, I would rather have received
it than written <i>Redgauntlet</i> or the sixth <i>Ã†neid</i>. All told,
if my books have enabled or helped me to make this voyage,
to know Rui, and to have received such a letter, they have
(in the old prefatorial expression) not been writ in vain.
It would seem from this that I have been not so much
humbled as puffed up; but, I assure you, I have in fact
been both. A little of what that letter says is my own
earning; not all, but yet a little; and the little makes
me proud, and all the rest ashamed; and in the contrast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
how much more beautiful altogether is the ancient man
than him of to-day!</p>

<p>Well, well, Henry James is pretty good, though he <i>is</i>
of the nineteenth century, and that glaringly. And to
curry favour with him, I wish I could be more explicit;
but, indeed, I am still of necessity extremely vague, and
cannot tell what I am to do, nor where I am to go for some
while yet. As soon as I am sure, you shall hear. All are
fairly well&mdash;the wife, your countrywoman, least of all;
troubles are not entirely wanting; but on the whole we
prosper, and we are all affectionately yours,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, April 2nd,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I am beginning to be ashamed of
writing on to you without the least acknowledgment, like
a tramp; but I do not care&mdash;I am hardened; and whatever
be the cause of your silence, I mean to write till all
is blue. I am outright ashamed of my news, which is
that we are not coming home for another year. I cannot
but hope it may continue the vast improvement of my
health: I think it good for Fanny and Lloyd; and we
have all a taste for this wandering and dangerous life. My
mother I send home, to my relief, as this part of our cruise
will be (if we can carry it out) rather difficult in places.
Here is the idea: about the middle of June (unless the
Boston Board objects) we sail from Honolulu in the missionary
ship (barquentine auxiliary steamer) <i>Morning
Star</i>: she takes us through the Gilberts and Marshalls,
and drops us (this is my great idea) on Ponape, one of
the volcanic islands of the Carolines. Here we stay
marooned among a doubtful population, with a Spanish
vice-governor and five native kings, and a sprinkling of
missionaries all at loggerheads, on the chance of fetching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
a passage to Sydney in a trader, a labour ship or (maybe,
but this appears too bright) a ship of war. If we can&rsquo;t
get the <i>Morning Star</i> (and the Board has many reasons
that I can see for refusing its permission) I mean to try
to fetch Fiji, hire a schooner there, do the Fijis and
Friendlies, hit the course of the <i>Richmond</i> at Tonga Tabu,
make back by Tahiti, and so to S. F., and home: perhaps
in June 1890. For the latter part of the cruise will
likely be the same in either case. You can see for yourself
how much variety and adventure this promises, and
that it is not devoid of danger at the best; but if we
can pull it off in safety, gives me a fine book of travel,
and Lloyd a fine lecture and diorama, which should vastly
better our finances.</p>

<p>I feel as if I were untrue to friendship; believe me,
Colvin, when I look forward to this absence of another
year, my conscience sinks at thought of the Monument;
but I think you will pardon me if you consider how much
this tropical weather mends my health. Remember me
as I was at home, and think of me sea-bathing and walking
about, as jolly as a sandboy: you will own the temptation
is strong; and as the scheme, bar fatal accidents, is
bound to pay into the bargain, sooner or later, it seems
it would be madness to come home now, with an imperfect
book, no illustrations to speak of, no diorama, and
perhaps fall sick again by autumn. I do not think I delude
myself when I say the tendency to catarrh has visibly
diminished.</p>

<p>It is a singular thing that as I was packing up old
papers ere I left Skerryvore, I came on the prophecies of
a drunken Highland sibyl, when I was seventeen. She
said I was to be very happy, to visit America, and <i>to be
much upon the sea</i>. It seems as if it were coming true
with a vengeance. Also, do you remember my strong,
old, rooted belief that I shall die by drowning? I don&rsquo;t
want that to come true, though it is an easy death; but
it occurs to me oddly, with these long chances in front.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
I cannot say why I like the sea; no man is more cynically
and constantly alive to its perils; I regard it as the
highest form of gambling; and yet I love the sea as
much as I hate gambling. Fine, clean emotions; a world
all and always beautiful; air better than wine; interest
unflagging; there is upon the whole no better life.&mdash;Yours
ever,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To E. L. Burlingame</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Honolulu, April</i> 1889.]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;This is to announce the most
prodigious change of programme. I have seen so much
of the South Seas that I desire to see more, and I get so
much health here that I dread a return to our vile climates.
I have applied accordingly to the missionary folk to let
me go round in the <i>Morning Star</i>; and if the Boston
Board should refuse, I shall get somehow to Fiji, hire a
trading schooner, and see the Fijis and Friendlies and
Samoa. He would be a South Seayer, Mr. Burlingame.
Of course, if I go in the <i>Morning Star</i>, I see all the eastern
(or western?) islands.</p>

<p>Before I sail, I shall make out to let you have the last
of <i>The Master</i>: though I tell you it sticks!&mdash;and I hope
to have had some proofs forbye, of the verses anyway.
And now to business.</p>

<p>I want (if you can find them) in the British sixpenny
edition, if not, in some equally compact and portable
shape&mdash;Seaside Library, for instance&mdash;the Waverley Novels
entire, or as entire as you can get &rsquo;em, and the following
of Marryat: <i>Phantom Ship</i>, <i>Peter Simple</i>, <i>Percival Keene</i>,
<i>Privateersman</i>, <i>Children of the New Forest</i>, <i>Frank Mildmay</i>,
<i>Newton Forster</i>, <i>Dog Fiend (Snarleyyow)</i>. Also <i>Midshipman
Easy</i>, <i>Kingsburn</i>, Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>French Revolution</i>, Motley&rsquo;s
<i>Dutch Republic</i>, Lang&rsquo;s <i>Letters on Literature</i>, a complete set
of my works, <i>Jenkin</i>, in duplicate; also <i>Familiar Studies</i>,
ditto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span></p>

<p>I have to thank you for the accounts, which are satisfactory
indeed, and for the cheque for $1000. Another
account will have come and gone before I see you. I
hope it will be equally roseate in colour. I am quite worked
out, and this cursed end of <i>The Master</i> hangs over me like
the arm of the gallows; but it is always darkest before
dawn, and no doubt the clouds will soon rise; but it is a
difficult thing to write, above all in Mackellarese; and I
cannot yet see my way clear. If I pull this off, <i>The Master</i>
will be a pretty good novel or I am the more deceived;
and even if I don&rsquo;t pull if off, it&rsquo;ll still have some stuff in it.</p>

<p>We shall remain here until the middle of June anyway;
but my mother leaves for Europe early in May.
Hence our mail should continue to come here; but not
hers. I will let you know my next address, which will
probably be Sydney. If we get on the <i>Morning Star</i>, I
propose at present to get marooned on Ponape, and take
my chance of getting a passage to Australia. It will leave
times and seasons mighty vague, and the cruise is risky;
but I shall know something of the South Seas when it is
done, or else the South Seas will contain all there is of me.
It should give me a fine book of travels, anyway.</p>

<p>Low will probably come and ask some dollars of you.
Pray let him have them, they are for outfit. O, another
complete set of my books should go to Captain A. H.
Otis, care of Dr. Merritt, Yacht <i>Casco</i>, Oakland, Cal.&mdash;In
haste,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To Miss Adelaide Boodle</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, April 6th,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS BOODLE</span>,&mdash;Nobody writes a better letter
than my Gamekeeper: so gay, so pleasant, so engagingly
particular, answering (by some delicate instinct) all the
questions she suggests. It is a shame you should get such
a poor return as I can make, from a mind essentially
and originally incapable of the art epistolary. I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
let the paper-cutter take my place; but I am sorry to
say the little wooden seaman did after the manner of
seamen, and deserted in the Societies. The place he seems
to have stayed at&mdash;seems, for his absence was not observed
till we were near the Equator&mdash;was Tautira, and, I assure
you, he displayed good taste, Tautira being as &ldquo;nigh hand
heaven&rdquo; as a paper-cutter or anybody has a right to expect.</p>

<p>I think all our friends will be very angry with us, and
I give the grounds of their probable displeasure bluntly&mdash;we
are not coming home for another year. My mother
returns next month. Fanny, Lloyd, and I push on again
among the islands on a trading schooner, the <i>Equator</i>&mdash;first
for the Gilbert group, which we shall have an opportunity
to explore thoroughly; then, if occasion serve, to
the Marshalls and Carolines; and if occasion (or money)
fail, to Samoa, and back to Tahiti. I own we are deserters,
but we have excuses. You cannot conceive how these
climates agree with the wretched house-plant of Skerryvore:
he wonders to find himself sea-bathing, and cutting
about the world loose, like a grown-up person. They
agree with Fanny too, who does not suffer from her rheumatism,
and with Lloyd also. And the interest of the
islands is endless; and the sea, though I own it is a fearsome
place, is very delightful. We had applied for places
in the American missionary ship, the <i>Morning Star</i>, but
this trading schooner is a far preferable idea, giving us
more time and a thousandfold more liberty; so we determined
to cut off the missionaries with a shilling.</p>

<p>The Sandwich Islands do not interest us very much;
we live here, oppressed with civilisation, and look for good
things in the future. But it would surprise you if you
came out to-night from Honolulu (all shining with electric
lights, and all in a bustle from the arrival of the mail,
which is to carry you these lines) and crossed the long
wooden causeway along the beach, and came out on the
road through Kapiolani park, and seeing a gate in the
palings, with a tub of gold-fish by the wayside, entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
casually in. The buildings stand in three groups by the
edge of the beach, where an angry little spitfire sea continually
spirts and thrashes with impotent irascibility, the
big seas breaking further out upon the reef. The first is
a small house, with a very large summer parlour, or <i>lanai</i>,
as they call it here, roofed, but practically open. There
you will find the lamps burning and the family sitting
about the table, dinner just done: my mother, my wife,
Lloyd, Belle, my wife&rsquo;s daughter, Austin her child, and
to-night (by way of rarity) a guest. All about the walls
our South Sea curiosities, war clubs, idols, pearl shells,
stone axes, etc.; and the walls are only a small part of
a lanai, the rest being glazed or latticed windows, or mere
open space. You will see there no sign of the Squire,
however; and being a person of a humane disposition, you
will only glance in over the balcony railing at the merrymakers
in the summer parlour, and proceed further afield
after the Exile. You look round, there is beautiful green
turf, many trees of an outlandish sort that drop thorns&mdash;look
out if your feet are bare; but I beg your pardon, you
have not been long enough in the South Seas&mdash;and many
oleanders in full flower. The next group of buildings is
ramshackle, and quite dark; you make out a coach-house
door, and look in&mdash;only some cocoanuts; you try round
to the left and come to the sea front, where Venus and
the moon are making luminous tracks on the water, and
a great swell rolls and shines on the outer reef; and here
is another door&mdash;all these places open from the outside&mdash;and
you go in, and find photography, tubs of water, negatives
steeping, a tap, and a chair and an ink-bottle, where
my wife is supposed to write; round a little further, a
third door, entering which you find a picture upon the
easel and a table sticky with paints; a fourth door admits
you to a sort of court, where there is a hen sitting&mdash;I
believe on a fallacious egg. No sign of the Squire in all
this. But right opposite the studio door you have
observed a third little house, from whose open door lamp-light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
streams and makes hay of the strong moonlight
shadows. You had supposed it made no part of the
grounds, for a fence runs round it lined with oleander;
but as the Squire is nowhere else, is it not just possible
he may be here? It is a grim little wooden shanty; cobwebs
bedeck it; friendly mice inhabit its recesses; the
mailed cockroach walks upon the wall; so also, I regret
to say, the scorpion. Herein are two pallet beds, two
mosquito curtains, strung to the pitch-boards of the roof,
two tables laden with books and manuscripts, three chairs,
and, in one of the beds, the Squire busy writing to yourself,
as it chances, and just at this moment somewhat
bitten by mosquitoes. He has just set fire to the insect
powder, and will be all right in no time; but just now
he contemplates large white blisters, and would like to
scratch them, but knows better. The house is not bare;
it has been inhabited by Kanakas, and&mdash;you know what
children are!&mdash;the bare wood walls are pasted over with
pages from the <i>Graphic</i>, <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, etc. The floor
is matted, and I am bound to say the matting is filthy.
There are two windows and two doors, one of which is
condemned; on the panels of that last a sheet of paper
is pinned up, and covered with writing. I cull a few
plums:&mdash;</p>

<p>What do you think this is? Simply life in the South
Seas foreshortened. These are a few of our desiderata
for the next trip, which we jot down as they occur.</p>

<p>There, I have really done my best and tried to send
something like a letter&mdash;one letter in return for all your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
dozens. Pray remember us all to yourself, Mrs. Boodle,
and the rest of your house. I do hope your mother will
be better when this comes. I shall write and give you
a new address when I have made up my mind as to the
most probable, and I do beg you will continue to write
from time to time and give us airs from home. To-morrow&mdash;think
of it&mdash;I must be off by a quarter to eight to drive
in to the palace and breakfast with his Hawaiian Majesty
at 8.30: I shall be dead indeed. Please give my news
to Scott, I trust he is better; give him my warm regards.
To you we all send all kinds of things, and I am the

<p class="to">To Charles Baxter</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, April</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;As usual, your letter is as good
as a cordial, and I thank you for it, and all your care,
kindness, and generous and thoughtful friendship, from
my heart. I was truly glad to hear a word of Colvin,
whose long silence has terrified me; and glad to hear
that you condoned the notion of my staying longer in the
South Seas, for I have decided in that sense. The first
idea was to go in the <i>Morning Star</i>, missionary ship; but
now I have found a trading schooner, the <i>Equator</i>, which
is to call for me here early in June and carry us through
the Gilberts. What will happen then, the Lord knows.
My mother does not accompany us: she leaves here for
home early in May, and you will hear of us from her; but
not, I imagine, anything more definite. We shall get
dumped on Butaritari, and whether we manage to go on
to the Marshalls and Carolines, or whether we fall back on
Samoa, Heaven must decide; but I mean to fetch back
into the course of the <i>Richmond</i>&mdash;(to think you don&rsquo;t
know what the <i>Richmond</i> is!&mdash;<i>the</i> steamer of the Eastern
South Seas, joining New Zealand, Tongatabu, the Samoas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
Taheite, and Rarotonga, and carrying by last advices
sheep in the saloon!)&mdash;into the course of the <i>Richmond</i>
and make Tahiti again on the home track. Would I
like to see the Scots Observer? Wouldn&rsquo;t I not? But
whaur? I&rsquo;m direckit at space. They have nae post
offishes at the Gilberts, and as for the Car&rsquo;lines! Ye see,
Mr. Baxter, we&rsquo;re no just in the punkshewal <i>centre</i> o&rsquo;
civ&rsquo;lisation. But pile them up for me, and when I&rsquo;ve
decided on an address, I&rsquo;ll let you ken, and ye&rsquo;ll can
send them stavin&rsquo; after me.&mdash;Ever your affectionate</p>

<p>The reference in the first paragraph is to the publication in the
press, which Mr. Baxter had permitted, of one of Stevenson&rsquo;s letters
written during the earlier part of his voyage. R. L. S. had remonstrated,
always greatly disliking the publication of private letters
during the writer&rsquo;s lifetime; and now writes to soften the effect of
his remonstrance.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, 10th May</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;I am appalled to gather from your
last just to hand that you have felt so much concern about
the letter. Pray dismiss it from your mind. But I think
you scarce appreciate how disagreeable it is to have your
private affairs and private unguarded expressions getting
into print. It would soon sicken any one of writing letters.
I have no doubt that letter was very wisely selected, but
it just shows how things crop up. There was a raging
jealousy between the two yachts; our captain was nearly
in a fight over it. However, no more; and whatever
you think, my dear fellow, do not suppose me angry with
you or &mdash;&mdash;; although I was <i>annoyed at the circumstance</i>&mdash;a
very different thing. But it is difficult to conduct life
by letter, and I continually feel I may be drifting into
some matter of offence, in which my heart takes no part.</p>

<p>I must now turn to a point of business. This new
cruise of ours is somewhat venturesome; and I think it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
needful to warn you not to be in a hurry to suppose us
dead. In these ill-charted seas, it is quite on the cards
we might be cast on some unvisited, or very rarely visited,
island; that there we might lie for a long time, even years,
unheard of; and yet turn up smiling at the hinder end.
So do not let me be &ldquo;rowpit&rdquo; till you get some certainty
we have gone to Davie Jones in a squall, or graced the
feast of some barbarian in the character of Long Pig.</p>

<p>I have just been a week away alone on the lee coast
of Hawaii, the only white creature in many miles, riding
five and a half hours one day, living with a native, seeing
four lepers shipped off to Molokai, hearing native causes,
and giving my opinion as <i>amicus curiÃ¦</i> as to the interpretation
of a statute in English; a lovely week among
God&rsquo;s best&mdash;at least God&rsquo;s sweetest works&mdash;Polynesians.
It has bettered me greatly. If I could only stay there the
time that remains, I could get my work done and be happy;
but the care of my family keeps me in vile Honolulu,
where I am always out of sorts, amidst heat and cold and
cesspools and beastly <i>haoles</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_31" id="FnAnchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> What is a haole? You are
one; and so, I am sorry to say, am I. After so long a
dose of whites, it was a blessing to get among Polynesians
again even for a week.</p>

<p>Well, Charles, there are waur haoles than yoursel&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll
say that for ye; and trust before I sail I shall get another
letter with more about yourself.&mdash;Ever your affectionate
friend,</p>

all.&mdash;I have at length finished <i>The Master</i>; it has been
a sore cross to me; but now he is buried, his body&rsquo;s under
hatches,&mdash;his soul, if there is any hell to go to, gone to
hell; and I forgive him: it is harder to forgive Burlingame
for having induced me to begin the publication, or myself
for suffering the induction.&mdash;Yes, I think Hole has done
finely; it will be one of the most adequately illustrated
books of our generation; he gets the note, he tells the
story&mdash;<i>my</i> story: I know only one failure&mdash;the Master
standing on the beach.&mdash;You must have a letter for me
at Sydney&mdash;till further notice. Remember me to Mrs.
Will. H., the godlike sculptor, and any of the faithful.
If you want to cease to be a republican, see my little
Kaiulani, as she goes through&mdash;but she is gone already.
You will die a red: I wear the colours of that little royal
maiden, <i>Nous allons chanter Ã  la ronde, si vous voulez!</i>
only she is not blonde by several chalks, though she is
but a half-blood, and the wrong half Edinburgh Scots like
mysel&rsquo;. But, O Low, I love the Polynesian: this civilisation
of ours is a dingy, ungentlemanly business; it drops
out too much of man, and too much of that the very
beauty of the poor beast: who has his beauties in spite
of Zola and Co. As usual, here is a whole letter with no
news: I am a bloodless, inhuman dog; and no doubt
Zola is a better correspondent.&mdash;Long live your fine old
English admiral&mdash;yours, I mean&mdash;the U.S.A. one at
Samoa; I wept tears and loved myself and mankind
when I read of him: he is not too much civilised. And
there was Gordon, too; and there are others, beyond
question. But if you could live, the only white folk, in
a Polynesian village; and drink that warm, light <i>vin du

of all about you&mdash;I will not gush, for I am now in my
fortieth year, which seems highly unjust, but there
it is, Mr. Low, and the Lord enlighten your affectionate</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This letter shows the writer in her character of wise and anxious
critic of her husband&rsquo;s work. The result, in the judgment of most
of his friends, went far to justify her misgivings.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, May 21st,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">BEST OF FRIENDS</span>,&mdash;It was a joy inexpressible to get a
word from you at last. Fortunately for our peace of mind,
we were almost positive that your letters had been sent
to the places we had already left. Still it was a bitter
disappointment to get nothing from you when we arrived
here. I wish you could have seen us both throwing over
the immense package of letters searching for your handwriting.
Now that we know you have been ill, please
do let some one send us a line to our next address telling
us how you are. What that next address may be we do
not yet know, as our final movements are a little uncertain.
To begin with, a trading schooner, the <i>Equator</i>, will
come along some time in the first part of June, lie outside the
harbour here and signal to us. Within forty-eight hours
we shall pack up our possessions, our barrel of sauer kraut,
our barrel of salt onions, our bag of cocoanuts, our native
garments, our tobacco, fish hooks, red combs, and Turkey
red calicoes (all the latter for trading purposes), our hand
organ, photograph and painting materials, and finally our
magic lantern&mdash;all these upon a large whaleboat, and go
out to the <i>Equator</i>. Lloyd, also, takes a fiddle, a guitar,
a native instrument something like a banjo, called a taropatch
fiddle, and a lot of song books. We shall be carried
first to one of the Gilberts, landing at Butaritari. The
<i>Equator</i> is going about amongst the Gilbert group, and
we have the right to keep her over when we like within
reasonable limits. Finally she will leave us, and we shall
have to take the chances of what happens next. We hope
to see the Marshalls, the Carolines, the Fijis, Tonga and
Samoa (also other islands that I do not remember), perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
staying a little while in Sydney, and stopping on our way
home to see our friends in Tahiti and the Marquesas. I am
very much exercised by one thing. Louis has the most
enchanting material that any one ever had in the whole
world for his book, and I am afraid he is going to spoil it
all. He has taken into his Scotch Stevenson head that a
stern duty lies before him, and that his book must be a
sort of scientific and historical impersonal thing, comparing
the different languages (of which he knows nothing,
really) and the different peoples, the object being to settle
the question as to whether they are of common Malay
origin or not. Also to compare the Protestant and Catholic
missions, etc., and the whole thing to be impersonal, leaving
out all he knows of the people themselves. And I believe
there is no one living who has got so near to them, or
who understands them as he does. Think of a small
treatise on the Polynesian races being offered to people
who are dying to hear about Ori a Ori, the making of
brothers with cannibals, the strange stories they told, and
the extraordinary adventures that befell us:&mdash;suppose
Herman Melville had given us his theories as to the Polynesian
language and the probable good or evil results of
the missionary influence instead of <i>Omoo</i> and <i>Typee</i>, or
Kinglake<a name="FnAnchor_32" id="FnAnchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> instead of <i>Eothen</i>. Louis says it is a stern
sense of duty that is at the bottom of it, which is more
alarming than anything else. I am so sure that you
will agree with me that I am going to ask you to throw
the weight of your influence as heavily as possible in the
scales with me. Please refer to the matter in the letters
we shall receive at our first stopping place, otherwise Louis
will spend a great deal of time in Sydney actually reading
up other people&rsquo;s books on the Islands. What a thing it
is to have a &ldquo;man of genius&rdquo; to deal with. It is like
managing an overbred horse. Why with my own feeble
hand I could write a book that the whole world would
jump at. Please keep any letters of mine that contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
any incidents of our wanderings. They are very exact
as to facts, and Louis may, in this conscientious state of
mind (indeed I am afraid he has), put nothing in his diary
but statistics. Even if I thought it a desirable thing to
write what he proposes, I should still think it impossible
unless after we had lived and studied here some twenty
years or more.</p>

<p>Now I am done with my complaining, and shall turn
to the pleasanter paths. Louis went to one of the other
islands a couple of weeks ago, quite alone, got drenched
with rain and surf, rode over mountain paths&mdash;five and a
half hours one day&mdash;and came back none the worse for it.
To-day he goes to Molokai, the leper island. He never has
a sign of hemorrhage, the air cushion is a thing of the
past, and altogether he is a new man. How he will do
in the English climate again I do not know, but in these
latitudes he is very nearly a well man, nothing seems to
do him harm but overwork. That, of course, is sometimes
difficult to prevent. Now, however, the <i>Master</i> is done,
we have enough money to go upon and there is no need
to work at all. I must stop. My dear love to you all.</p>

<p class="to">To Mrs. R. L. Stevenson</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following two letters were written during and immediately
after Stevenson&rsquo;s trip to the noted leper settlement, the scene of
Father Damien&rsquo;s labours, at Molokai.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Kalawao, Molokai</i> [<i>May</i> 1889].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR FANNY</span>,&mdash;I had a lovely sail up. Captain Cameron
and Mr. Gilfillan, both born in the States, yet the first still
with a strong Highland, and the second still with a strong
Lowland accent, were good company; the night was warm,
the victuals plain but good. Mr. Gilfillan gave me his berth,
and I slept well, though I heard the sisters sick in the next
stateroom, poor souls. Heavy rolling woke me in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
morning; I turned in all standing, so went right on the
upper deck. The day was on the peep out of a low morning
bank, and we were wallowing along under stupendous
cliffs. As the lights brightened, we could see certain abutments
and buttresses on their front where wood clustered
and grass grew brightly. But the whole brow seemed
quite impassable, and my heart sank at the sight. Two
thousand feet of rock making 19Â° (the Captain guesses)
seemed quite beyond my powers. However, I had come
so far; and, to tell you the truth, I was so cowed with
fear and disgust that I dared not go back on the adventure
in the interests of my own self-respect. Presently
we came up with the leper promontory: lowland, quite
bare and bleak and harsh, a little town of wooden houses,
two churches, a landing-stair, all unsightly, sour, northerly,
lying athwart the sunrise, with the great wall of the pali
cutting the world out on the south. Our lepers were sent
on the first boat, about a dozen, one poor child very horrid,
one white man, leaving a large grown family behind him
in Honolulu, and then into the second stepped the sisters
and myself. I do not know how it would have been with
me had the sisters not been there. My horror of the
horrible is about my weakest point; but the moral loveliness
at my elbow blotted all else out; and when I found
that one of them was crying, poor soul, quietly under her
veil, I cried a little myself; then I felt as right as a trivet,
only a little crushed to be there so uselessly. I thought
it was a sin and a shame she should feel unhappy; I turned
round to her, and said something like this: &ldquo;Ladies, God
Himself is here to give you welcome. I&rsquo;m sure it is good
for me to be beside you; I hope it will be blessed to me;
I thank you for myself and the good you do me.&rdquo; It
seemed to cheer her up; but indeed I had scarce said it
when we were at the landing-stairs, and there was a great
crowd, hundreds of (God save us!) pantomime masks in
poor human flesh, waiting to receive the sisters and the
new patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span></p>

<p>Every hand was offered: I had gloves, but I had made
up my mind on the boat&rsquo;s voyage <i>not</i> to give my hand;
that seemed less offensive than the gloves. So the sisters
and I went up among that crew, and presently I got aside
(for I felt I had no business there) and set off on foot
across the promontory, carrying my wrap and the camera.
All horror was quite gone from me: to see these dread
creatures smile and look happy was beautiful. On my
way through Kalaupapa I was exchanging cheerful <i>alohas</i>
with the patients coming galloping over on their horses;
I was stopping to gossip at house-doors; I was happy,
only ashamed of myself that I was here for no good. One
woman was pretty, and spoke good English, and was
infinitely engaging and (in the old phrase) towardly; she
thought I was the new white patient; and when she found
I was only a visitor, a curious change came in her face
and voice&mdash;the only sad thing, morally sad, I mean&mdash;that
I met that morning. But for all that, they tell me none
want to leave. Beyond Kalaupapa the houses became
rare; dry stone dykes, grassy, stony land, one sick pandanus;
a dreary country; from overhead in the little
clinging wood shogs of the pali chirruping of birds fell;
the low sun was right in my face; the trade blew pure and
cool and delicious; I felt as right as ninepence, and stopped
and chatted with the patients whom I still met on their
horses, with not the least disgust. About half-way over,
I met the superintendent (a leper) with a horse for me,
and O, wasn&rsquo;t I glad! But the horse was one of those
curious, dogged, cranky brutes that always dully want to
go somewhere else, and my traffic with him completed
my crushing fatigue. I got to the guest-house, an empty
house with several rooms, kitchen, bath, etc. There was
no one there, and I let the horse go loose in the garden,
lay down on the bed, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Dr. Swift woke me and gave me breakfast, then I came
back and slept again while he was at the dispensary, and
he woke me for dinner; and I came back and slept again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
and he woke me about six for supper; and then in about
an hour I felt tired again, and came up to my solitary
guest-house, played the flageolet, and am now writing to
you. As yet, you see, I have seen nothing of the settlement,
and my crushing fatigue (though I believe that was
moral and a measure of my cowardice) and the doctor&rsquo;s
opinion make me think the pali hopeless. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
look a strong man,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;but are you
sound?&rdquo; I told him the truth; then he said it was out
of the question, and if I were to get up at all, I must be
carried up. But, as it seems, men as well as horses continually
fall on this ascent: the doctor goes up with a
change of clothes&mdash;it is plain that to be carried would in
itself be very fatiguing to both mind and body; and I
should then be at the beginning of thirteen miles of mountain
road to be ridden against time. How should I come
through? I hope you will think me right in my decision:
I mean to stay, and shall not be back in Honolulu till
Saturday, June first. You must all do the best you can
to make ready.</p>

<p>Dr. Swift has a wife and an infant son, beginning to
toddle and run, and they live here as composed as brick
and mortar&mdash;at least the wife does, a Kentucky German,
a fine enough creature, I believe, who was quite amazed
at the sisters shedding tears! How strange is mankind!
Gilfillan too, a good fellow I think, and far from a stupid,
kept up his hard Lowland Scottish talk in the boat while
the sister was covering her face; but I believe he knew,
and did it (partly) in embarrassment, and part perhaps
in mistaken kindness. And that was one reason, too,
why I made my speech to them. Partly, too, I did it,
because I was ashamed to do so, and remembered one
of my golden rules, &ldquo;When you are ashamed to speak,
speak up at once.&rdquo; But, mind you, that rule is only
golden with strangers; with your own folks, there are
other considerations. This is a strange place to be in.
A bell has been sounded at intervals while I wrote, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
all is still but a musical humming of the sea, not unlike
the sound of telegraph wires; the night is quite cool and
pitch dark, with a small fine rain; one light over in the
leper settlement, one cricket whistling in the garden, my
lamp here by my bedside, and my pen cheeping between
my inky fingers.</p>

<p>Next day, lovely morning, slept all night, 80Â° in the
shade, strong, sweet Anaho trade-wind.</p>

<p class="sc rt">Louis.</p>


<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, June</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I am just home after twelve days&rsquo;
journey to Molokai, seven of them at the leper settlement,
where I can only say that the sight of so much
courage, cheerfulness, and devotion strung me too high to
mind the infinite pity and horror of the sights. I used to
ride over from Kalawao to Kalaupapa (about three miles
across the promontory, the cliff-wall, ivied with forest
and yet inaccessible from steepness, on my left), go to the
Sisters&rsquo; home, which is a miracle of neatness, play a game
of croquet with seven leper girls (90Â° in the shade), got a
little old-maid meal served me by the Sisters, and ride
home again, tired enough, but not too tired. The girls
have all dolls, and love dressing them. You who know so
many ladies delicately clad, and they who know so many
dressmakers, please make it known it would be an acceptable
gift to send scraps for doll dressmaking to the Reverend
Sister Maryanne, Bishop Home, Kalaupapa, Molokai,
Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p>I have seen sights that cannot be told, and heard
stories that cannot be repeated: yet I never admired my
poor race so much, nor (strange as it may seem) loved life
more than in the settlement. A horror of moral beauty
broods over the place: that&rsquo;s like bad Victor Hugo, but
it is the only way I can express the sense that lived with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
me all these days. And this even though it was in great
part Catholic, and my sympathies flow never with so much
difficulty as towards Catholic virtues. The passbook kept
with heaven stirs me to anger and laughter. One of the
sisters calls the place &ldquo;the ticket office to heaven.&rdquo; Well,
what is the odds? They do their darg, and do it with
kindness and efficiency incredible; and we must take folks&rsquo;
virtues as we find them, and love the better part. Of old
Damien, whose weaknesses and worse perhaps I heard
fully, I think only the more. It was a European peasant:
dirty, bigoted, untruthful, unwise, tricky, but superb with
generosity, residual candour and fundamental good-humour:
convince him he had done wrong (it might take
hours of insult) and he would undo what he had done and
like his corrector better. A man, with all the grime and
paltriness of mankind, but a saint and hero all the more
for that. The place as regards scenery is grand, gloomy,
and bleak. Mighty mountain walls descending sheer along
the whole face of the island into a sea unusually deep; the
front of the mountain ivied and furred with clinging forest,
one viridescent cliff: about half-way from east to west, the
low, bare, stony promontory edged in between the cliff and
the ocean; the two little towns (Kalawao and Kalaupapa)
seated on either side of it, as bare almost as bathing machines
upon a beach; and the population&mdash;gorgons and chimaeras
dire. All this tear of the nerves I bore admirably; and
the day after I got away, rode twenty miles along the
opposite coast and up into the mountains: they call it
twenty, I am doubtful of the figures: I should guess it
nearer twelve; but let me take credit for what residents
allege; and I was riding again the day after, so I need
say no more about health. Honolulu does not agree with
me at all: I am always out of sorts there, with slight headache,
blood to the head, etc. I had a good deal of work
to do and did it with miserable difficulty; and yet all the
time I have been gaining strength, as you see, which is
highly encouraging. By the time I am done with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
cruise I shall have the material for a very singular book of
travels: names of strange stories and characters, cannibals,
pirates, ancient legends, old Polynesian poetry,&mdash;never
was so generous a farrago. I am going down now
to get the story of a shipwrecked family, who were fifteen
months on an island with a murderer: there is a specimen.
The Pacific is a strange place; the nineteenth century
only exists there in spots: all round, it is a no man&rsquo;s
land of the ages, a stir-about of epochs and races, barbarisms
and civilisations, virtues and crimes.</p>

<p>It is good of you to let me stay longer, but if I had
known how ill you were, I should be now on my way
home. I had chartered my schooner and made all arrangements
before (at last) we got definite news. I feel highly
guilty; I should be back to insult and worry you a little.
Our address till further notice is to be c/o R. Towns &amp;
Co., Sydney. That is final: I only got the arrangement
made yesterday; but you may now publish it abroad.&mdash;Yours
ever,</p>

to tell; and you may bless God you are a man so sound-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
that (even in the freshness of your calamity) I
can come to you with my own good fortune unashamed
and secure of sympathy. It is a good thing to be a good
man, whether deaf or whether dumb; and of all our fellow-craftsmen
(whom yet they count a jealous race), I never
knew one but gave you the name of honesty and kindness:
come to think of it gravely, this is better than the finest
hearing. We are all on the march to deafness, blindness,
and all conceivable and fatal disabilities; we shall not
all get there with a report so good. My good news is a
health astonishingly reinstated. This climate; these
voyagings; these landfalls at dawn; new islands peaking
from the morning bank; new forested harbours; new
passing alarms of squalls and surf; new interests of gentle
natives,&mdash;the whole tale of my life is better to me than
any poem.</p>

<p>I am fresh just now from the leper settlement of Molokai,
playing croquet with seven leper girls, sitting and
yarning with old, blind, leper beachcombers in the hospital,
sickened with the spectacle of abhorrent suffering and
deformation amongst the patients, touched to the heart
by the sight of lovely and effective virtues in their helpers:
no stranger time have I ever had, nor any so moving. I
do not think it a little thing to be deaf, God knows, and
God defend me from the same!&mdash;but to be a leper, or
one of the self-condemned, how much more awful! and
yet there&rsquo;s a way there also. &ldquo;There are Molokais everywhere,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dutton, Father Damien&rsquo;s dresser; you
are but new landed in yours; and my dear and kind
adviser, I wish you, with all my soul, that patience and
courage which you will require. Think of me meanwhile
on a trading schooner bound for the Gilbert Islands, thereafter
for the Marshalls, with a diet of fish and cocoanut
before me; bound on a cruise of&mdash;well, of investigation to
what islands we can reach, and to get (some day or other)
to Sydney, where a letter addressed to the care of R.
Towns &amp; Co. will find me sooner or later; and if it contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
any good news, whether of your welfare or the courage
with which you bear the contrary, will do me good.&mdash;Yours
affectionately (although so near a stranger),</p>

<p class="to">To Lady Taylor</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Honolulu, June 19th,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LADY TAYLOR</span>,&mdash;Our new home, the <i>Equator</i>,
trading schooner, rides at the buoy to-night, and we are
for sea shortly. All your folk of the Roost held us for
phantoms and things of the night from our first appearance;
but I do wish you would try to believe in our continued
existence, as flesh and blood obscurely tossed in
the Pacific, or walking coral shores, and in our affection,
which is more constant than becomes the breasts of such
absconders. My good health does not cease to be wonderful
to myself: Fanny is better in these warm places; it
is the very thing for Lloyd; and in the matter of interest,
the spice of life, etc., words cannot depict what fun we
have. Try to have a little more patience with the fugitives,
and think of us now and again among the Gilberts,
where we ought to be about the time when you receive
this scrap. They make no great figure on the atlas, I
confess; but you will see the name there, if you look&mdash;which
I wish you would, and try to conceive us as still
extant. We all send the kindest remembrances to all of
you; please make one of the girls write us the news to
the care of R. Towns &amp; Co., Sydney, New South Wales,
where we hope to bring up about the end of the year&mdash;or
later. Do not forget yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Stevenson and his party sailed accordingly on the trading
schooner <i>Equator</i>, &ldquo;on a certain bright June day in 1889,&rdquo; for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
Gilbert Islands, a scattered group of atolls in the Western Pacific.
Their expectation was to come back into civilisation again by way
of the Carolines, Manila, and the China ports; but instead of this,
circumstances which occurred to change the trader&rsquo;s course took
them southwards to Samoa, where they arrived in December of the
same year. Their second voyage was thus of six months&rsquo; duration;
in the course of it they spent two periods of about six weeks each
on land, first at one and then at another of the two island capitals,
Butaritari and Apemama. The following letter is the first which
reached Stevenson&rsquo;s friends from this part of his voyage, and was
written in two instalments, the first from on board the <i>Equator</i> in
the lagoon of the island of Apaiang; the second, six weeks later,
from the settlement on shore at Apemama, which the king, his friend
Temhinoka, allowed him and his party to occupy during their stay.
The account of this stay at Apemama and of the character of the
king is far the most interesting and attractive part of the volume
called <i>In the South Seas</i>, which was the literary result of these voyages.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Schooner</i> Equator, <i>Apaiang Lagoon</i>,
<i>August 22nd,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;The missionary ship is outside the
reef trying (vainly) to get in; so I may have a chance to
get a line off. I am glad to say I shall be home by June
next for the summer, or we shall know the reason why.
For God&rsquo;s sake be well and jolly for the meeting. I shall
be, I believe, a different character from what you have
seen this long while. This cruise is up to now a huge
success, being interesting, pleasant, and profitable. The
beachcomber is perhaps the most interesting character here;
the natives are very different, on the whole, from Polynesians:
they are moral, stand-offish (for good reasons),
and protected by a dark tongue. It is delightful to meet
the few Hawaiians (mostly missionaries) that are dotted
about, with their Italian <i>brio</i> and their ready friendliness.
The whites are a strange lot, many of them good, kind,
pleasant fellows; others quite the lowest I have ever seen
even in the slums of cities. I wish I had time to narrate
to you the doings and character of three white murderers
(more or less proven) I have met. One, the only undoubted
assassin of the lot, quite gained my affection in
his big home out of a wreck, with his New Hebrides wife
in her savage turban of hair and yet a perfect lady, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
his three adorable little girls in Rob Roy Macgregor dresses,
dancing to the hand organ, performing circus on the floor
with startling effects of nudity, and curling up together
on a mat to sleep, three sizes, three attitudes, three Rob
Roy dresses, and six little clenched fists: the murderer
meanwhile brooding and gloating over his chicks, till your
whole heart went out to him; and yet his crime on the
face of it was dark: disembowelling, in his own house,
an old man of seventy, and him drunk.</p>

<p>It is lunch-time, I see, and I must close up with my
warmest love to you. I wish you were here to sit upon
me when required. Ah! if you were but a good sailor!
I will never leave the sea, I think; it is only there that
a Briton lives: my poor grandfather, it is from him I
inherit the taste, I fancy, and he was round many islands
in his day; but I, please God, shall beat him at that
before the recall is sounded. Would you be surprised to
learn that I contemplate becoming a shipowner? I do,
but it is a secret. Life is far better fun than people dream
who fall asleep among the chimney stacks and telegraph
wires.</p>

<p>Love to Henry James and others near.&mdash;Ever yours,
my dear fellow,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="rt pt2"><i>Equator Town, Apemama, October</i> 1889.</p>

<p>No <i>Morning Star</i> came, however; and so now I try
to send this to you by the schooner <i>J. L. Tiernan</i>. We
have been about a month ashore, camping out in a kind
of town the king set up for us: on the idea that I was
really a &ldquo;big chief&rdquo; in England. He dines with us sometimes,
and sends up a cook for a share of our meals when
he does not come himself. This sounds like high living!
alas, undeceive yourself. Salt junk is the mainstay; a
low island, except for cocoanuts, is just the same as a
ship at sea: brackish water, no supplies, and very little
shelter. The king is a great character&mdash;a thorough tyrant,
very much of a gentleman, a poet, a musician, a historian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
or perhaps rather more a genealogist&mdash;it is strange to see
him lying in his house among a lot of wives (nominal wives)
writing the History of Apemama in an account-book; his
description of one of his own songs, which he sang to me
himself, as &ldquo;about sweethearts, and trees, and the sea&mdash;and
no true, all-the-same lie,&rdquo; seems about as compendious
a definition of lyric poetry as a man could ask. Tembinoka
is here the great attraction: all the rest is heat
and tedium and villainous dazzle, and yet more villainous
mosquitoes. We are like to be here, however, many a
long week before we get away, and then whither? A
strange trade this voyaging: so vague, so bound-down,
so helpless. Fanny has been planting some vegetables,
and we have actually onions and radishes coming up: ah,
onion-despiser, were you but a while in a low island, how
your heart would leap at sight of a coster&rsquo;s barrow! I
think I could shed tears over a dish of turnips. No doubt
we shall all be glad to say farewell to low islands&mdash;I had
near said for ever. They are very tame; and I begin to
read up the directory, and pine for an island with a profile,
a running brook, or were it only a well among the
rocks. The thought of a mango came to me early this
morning and set my greed on edge; but you do not know
what a mango is, so&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I have been thinking a great deal of you and the Monument
of late, and even tried to get my thoughts into a
poem, hitherto without success. God knows how you
are: I begin to weary dreadfully to see you&mdash;well, in nine
months, I hope; but that seems a long time. I wonder
what has befallen me too, that flimsy part of me that lives
(or dwindles) in the public mind; and what has befallen
<i>The Master</i>, and what kind of a Box the Merry Box has
been found. It is odd to know nothing of all this. We
had an old woman to do devil-work for you about a month
ago, in a Chinaman&rsquo;s house on Apaiang (August 23rd or
24th), You should have seen the crone with a noble
masculine face, like that of an old crone [<i>sic</i>], a body like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
a man&rsquo;s (naked all but the feathery female girdle), knotting
cocoanut leaves and muttering spells: Fanny and I, and
the good captain of the <i>Equator</i>, and the Chinaman and
his native wife and sister-in-law, all squatting on the
floor about the sibyl; and a crowd of dark faces watching
from behind her shoulder (she sat right in the doorway)
and tittering aloud with strange, appalled, embarrassed
laughter at each fresh adjuration. She informed us you
were in England, not travelling and now no longer sick;
she promised us a fair wind the next day, and we had it,
so I cherish the hope she was as right about Sidney Colvin.
The shipownering has rather petered out since I last
wrote, and a good many other plans beside.</p>

<p>Health? Fanny very so-so; I pretty right upon the
whole, and getting through plenty work: I know not
quite how, but it seems to me not bad and in places
funny.</p>

upon, or even not at all, in my travel book; and the yarns
are good, I do believe. <i>The Pearl Fisher</i> is for the New
York Ledger: the yarn is a kind of Monte Cristo one.
<i>The Wrecker</i> is the least good as a story, I think; but
the characters seem to me good. <i>The Beachcombers</i> is
more sentimental. These three scarce touch the out-skirts
of the life we have been viewing; a hot-bed of
strange characters and incidents: Lord, how different
from Europe or the Pallid States! Farewell. Heaven

<p>The following, written in the last days of the sail southwards from
the Gilberts to Samoa, contains the full plan of the South Sea book
as it had now been conceived. In the issue, Part I. (so far as I
know) was never written; Parts II. and III. appeared serially in the
New York Sun, and were reprinted with corrections in the volume
called <i>In the South Seas</i>; Part IV. was never written; Part V. was
written but has not been printed, at least in this country; Part VI.
(and far the most successful) closes the volume <i>In the South Seas</i>;
Part VII. developed itself into <i>A Footnote to History</i>. The verses at
the end of this letter have already been printed (<i>Songs of Travel</i>,
vol. xiv., p. 244); but I give them here with the context, as in
similar instances above. The allusion is to the two colossal images
from Easter Island which used to stand under the portico to the
right hand of the visitor entering the Museum, were for some years
removed, and are now restored to their old place.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Schooner</i> Equator, <i>at sea. 190 miles off Samoa.<br />
Monday, December 2nd,</i> 1889.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;We are just nearing the end of our
long cruise. Rain, calms, squalls, bang&mdash;there&rsquo;s the foretopmast
gone; rain, calm, squalls, away with the stay-sail;
more rain, more calm, more squalls; a prodigious
heavy sea all the time, and the <i>Equator</i> staggering and
hovering like a swallow in a storm; and the cabin, a great
square, crowded with wet human beings, and the rain
avalanching on the deck, and the leaks dripping everywhere:
Fanny, in the midst of fifteen males, bearing up
wonderfully. But such voyages are at the best a trial.
We had one particularity: coming down on Winslow Reef,
p. d. (position doubtful): two positions in the directory, a
third (if you cared to count that) on the chart; heavy sea
running, and the night due. The boats were cleared,
bread put on board, and we made up our packets for a
boat voyage of four or five hundred miles, and turned in,
expectant of a crash. Needless to say it did not come,
and no doubt we were far to leeward. If we only had
twopenceworth of wind, we might be at dinner in Apia
to-morrow evening; but no such luck: here we roll,
dead before a light air&mdash;and that is no point of sailing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
all for a fore and aft schooner&mdash;the sun blazing overhead,
thermometer 88Â°, four degrees above what I have learned to
call South Sea temperature; but for all that, land so near,
and so much grief being happily astern, we are all pretty
gay on board, and have been photographing and draught-playing
and sky-larking like anything. I am minded to
stay not very long in Samoa and confine my studies there
(as far as any one can forecast) to the history of the late
war. My book is now practically modelled: if I can
execute what is designed, there are few better books now
extant on this globe, bar the epics, and the big tragedies,
and histories, and the choice lyric poetics, and a novel
or so&mdash;none. But it is not executed yet; and let not
him that putteth on his armour, vaunt himself. At least,
nobody has had such stuff; such wild stories, such beautiful
scenes, such singular intimacies, such manners and
traditions, so incredible a mixture of the beautiful and
horrible, the savage and civilised. I will give you here
some idea of the table of contents, which ought to make
your mouth water. I propose to call the book <i>The South
Seas</i>: it is rather a large title, but not many people have
seen more of them than I, perhaps no one&mdash;certainly no
one capable of using the material.</p>

<p class="noind">Even as so sketched it makes sixty chapters, not less than

Samoa has yet to be accounted for: I think it will be
all history, and I shall work in observations on Samoan
manners, under the similar heads in other Polynesian
islands. It is still possible, though unlikely, that I may
add a passing visit to Fiji or Tonga, or even both; but I
am growing impatient to see yourself, and I do not want
to be later than June of coming to England. Anyway,
you see it will be a large work, and as it will be copiously
illustrated, the Lord knows what it will cost. We shall
return, God willing, by Sydney, Ceylon, Suez and, I guess,
Marseilles the many-masted (copyright epithet). I shall
likely pause a day or two in Paris, but all that is too far
ahead&mdash;although now it begins to look near&mdash;so near, and
I can hear the rattle of the hansom up Endell Street, and
see the gates swing back, and feel myself jump out upon
the Monument steps&mdash;Hosanna!&mdash;home again. My dear
fellow, now that my father is done with his troubles, and
17 Heriot Row no more than a mere shell, you and that
gaunt old Monument in Bloomsbury are all that I have
in view when I use the word home; some passing thoughts
there may be of the rooms at Skerryvore, and the blackbirds
in the chine on a May morning; but the essence
is S.C. and the Museum. Suppose, by some damned
accident, you were no more; well, I should return just

lost. I will copy for you here a copy of verses made in

Wrecker</i>; and in book form will appear as number 1 of
<i>South Sea Yarns</i> by R. L. S. and Lloyd Osbourne. Here
is the table as far as fully conceived, and indeed executed.<a name="FnAnchor_33" id="FnAnchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>...</p>

<p>The story is founded on fact, the mystery I really
believe to be insoluble; the purchase of a wreck has
never been handled before, no more has San Francisco.
These seem all elements of success. There is, besides,
a character, Jim Pinkerton, of the advertising American,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
on whom we build a good deal; and some sketches of
the American merchant marine, opium smuggling in
Honolulu, etc. It should run to (about) three hundred
pages of my MS. I would like to know if this tale smiles
upon you, if you will have a vacancy, and what you will
be willing to pay. It will of course be copyright in
both the States and England. I am a little anxious to
have it tried serially, as it tests the interest of the
mystery.</p>

<p><i>Pleasure.</i>&mdash;We have had a fine time in the Gilbert
group, though four months on low islands, which involves
low diet, is a largeish order; and my wife is rather down.
I am myself, up to now, a pillar of health, though our long
and vile voyage of calms, squalls, cataracts of rain, sails
carried away, foretopmast lost, boats cleared and packets
made on the approach of a p. d. reef, etc., has cured me
of salt brine, and filled me with a longing for beef steak
and mangoes not to be depicted. The interest has been
immense. Old King Tembinoka of Apemama, the Napoleon
of the group, poet, tyrant, altogether a man of mark, gave
me the woven corselets of his grandfather, his father and
his uncle, and, what pleased me more, told me their singular
story, then all manner of strange tales, facts, and experiences
for my South Sea book, which should be a Tearer,
Mr. Burlingame: no one at least has had such stuff.</p>

<p>We are now engaged in the hell of a dead calm, the
heat is cruel&mdash;it is the only time when I suffer from heat:
I have nothing on but a pair of serge trousers, and a
singlet without sleeves of Oxford gauze&mdash;O, yes, and a red
sash about my waist; and yet as I sit here in the cabin,
sweat streams from me. The rest are on deck under a
bit of awning; we are not much above a hundred miles
from port, and we might as well be in Kamschatka. However,
I should be honest: this is the first calm I have
endured without the added bane of a heavy swell, and the
intoxicated blue-bottle wallowings and knockings of the
helpless ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span></p>

<p>I wonder how you liked the end of <i>The Master</i>; that
was the hardest job I ever had to do; did I do it?</p>

<p>My wife begs to be remembered to yourself and Mrs.
Burlingame. Remember all of us to all friends, particularly
Low, in case I don&rsquo;t get a word through for him.&mdash;I
am, yours very sincerely,</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following was written soon after the termination of the
voyage of the <i>Equator</i> and Stevenson&rsquo;s first landing in Samoa, where
he was engaged in collecting materials for the account (then intended
to be the concluding part of his great projected South Sea book)
of the war and hurricane of the previous year.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Samoa</i> [<i>December</i> 1889].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BAXTER</span>,&mdash; ... I cannot return until I have
seen either Tonga or Fiji or both: and I must not leave
here till I have finished my collections on the war&mdash;a very
interesting bit of history, the truth often very hard to
come at, and the search (for me) much complicated by the
German tongue, from the use of which I have desisted
(I suppose) these fifteen years. The last two days I have
been mugging with a dictionary from five to six hours
a day; besides this, I have to call upon, keep sweet, and
judiciously interview all sorts of persons&mdash;English, American,
German, and Samoan. It makes a hard life; above
all, as after every interview I have to come and get my
notes straight on the nail. I believe I should have got
my facts before the end of January, when I shall make
for Tonga or Fiji. I am down right in the hurricane
season; but they had so bad a one last year, I don&rsquo;t
imagine there will be much of an edition this. Say that
I get to Sydney some time in April, and I shall have done
well, and be in a position to write a very singular and
interesting book, or rather two; for I shall begin, I think,
with a separate opuscule on the Samoan Trouble, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
as long as <i>Kidnapped</i>, not very interesting, but valuable&mdash;and
a thing proper to be done. And then, hey! for the
big South Sea Book: a devil of a big one, and full of the
finest sport.</p>

<p>This morning as I was going along to my breakfast
a little before seven, reading a number of Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine, I was startled by a soft <i>talofa, alii</i> (note for
my mother: they are quite courteous here in the European
style, quite unlike Tahiti), right in my ear: it was Mataafa
coming from early mass in his white coat and white linen
kilt, with three fellows behind him. Mataafa is the nearest
thing to a hero in my history, and really a fine fellow;
plenty sense, and the most dignified, quiet, gentle manners.
Talking of Blackwood&mdash;a file of which I was lucky enough
to find here in the lawyer&rsquo;s&mdash;Mrs. Oliphant seems in a
staggering state: from the <i>Wrong Box</i> to <i>The Master</i> I
scarce recognise either my critic or myself. I gather that
<i>The Master</i> should do well, and at least that notice is
agreeable reading. I expect to be home in June: you
will have gathered that I am pretty well. In addition to
my labours, I suppose I walk five or six miles a day, and
almost every day I ride up and see Fanny and Lloyd, who
are in a house in the bush with Ah Fu. I live in Apia
for history&rsquo;s sake with Moors, an American trader. Day
before yesterday I was arrested and fined for riding fast
in the street, which made my blood bitter, as the wife of
the manager of the German Firm has twice almost ridden
me down, and there seems none to say her nay. The
Germans have behaved pretty badly here, but not in all
ways so ill as you may have gathered: they were doubtless
much provoked; and if the insane Knappe had not
appeared upon the scene, might have got out of the muddle
with dignity. I write along without rhyme or reason, as
things occur to me.</p>

<p>I hope from my outcries about printing you do not
think I want you to keep my news or letters in a Blue
Beard closet. I like all friends to hear of me; they all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
should if I had ninety hours in the day, and strength for
all of them; but you must have gathered how hard
worked I am, and you will understand I go to bed a pretty
tired man.</p>


<p class="rt pt2"><i>29th December</i> [1889].</p>

<p>To-morrow (Monday, I won&rsquo;t swear to my day of the
month; this is the Sunday between Christmas and New
Year) I go up the coast with Mr. Clarke, one of the London
Society missionaries, in a boat to examine schools, see
Tamasese, etc. Lloyd comes to photograph. Pray Heaven
we have good weather; this is the rainy season; we shall
be gone four or five days; and if the rain keep off, I shall
be glad of the change; if it rain, it will be beastly. This
explains still further how hard pressed I am, as the mail
will be gone ere I return, and I have thus lost the days I
meant to write in. I have a boy, Henry, who interprets
and copies for me, and is a great nuisance. He said he
wished to come to me in order to learn &ldquo;long explessions.&rdquo;
Henry goes up along with us; and as I am not fond of him,
he may before the trip is over hear some &ldquo;stlong explessions.&rdquo;
I am writing this on the back balcony at Moors&rsquo;,
palms and a hill like the hill of Kinnoull looking in at me;
myself lying on the floor, and (like the parties in Handel&rsquo;s
song) &ldquo;clad in robes of virgin white&rdquo;; the ink is dreadful,
the heat delicious, a fine going breeze in the palms, and from
the other side of the house the sudden angry splash and
roar of the Pacific on the reef, where the warships are
still piled from last year&rsquo;s hurricane, some under water,
one high and dry upon her side, the strangest figure of
a ship was ever witnessed; the narrow bay there is full
of ships; the men-of-war covered with sail after the rains,
and (especially the German ship, which is fearfully and
awfully top heavy) rolling almost yards in, in what appears
to be calm water.</p>

<p>Samoa, Apia at least, is far less beautiful than the
Marquesas or Tahiti: a more gentle scene, gentler acclivities,
a tamer face of nature; and this much aided, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
the wanderer, by the great German plantations with their
countless regular avenues of palms. The island has beautiful
rivers, of about the bigness of our waters in the Lothians,
with pleasant pools and waterfalls and overhanging verdure,
and often a great volume of sound, so that once I thought
I was passing near a mill, and it was only the voice of
the river. I am not specially attracted by the people;
but they are courteous; the women very attractive, and
dress lovely; the men purposelike, well set up, tall, lean,
and dignified. As I write, the breeze is brisking up, doors
are beginning to slam, and shutters; a strong draught
sweeps round the balcony; it looks doubtful for to-morrow.
Here I shut up.&mdash;Ever your affectionate</p>

<p class="to">To Lady Taylor</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This letter contains the first announcement of the purchase of
the Vailima estate (not yet so named). Sir Percy Shelley had died
in the previous December.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Apia, Samoa, Jan. 20th,</i> 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LADY TAYLOR</span>,&mdash;I shall hope to see you in
some months from now, when I come home&mdash;to break up
my establishment&mdash;I know no diminutive of the word.
Your daughters cast a spell upon me; they were always
declaring I was a winged creature and would vanish into
the uttermost isle; and they were right, and I have made
my preparations. I am now the owner of an estate upon
Upolu, some two or three miles behind and above Apia;
three streams, two waterfalls, a great cliff, an ancient
native fort, a view of the sea and lowlands, or (to be more
precise) several views of them in various directions, are
now mine. It would be affectation to omit a good many
head of cattle; above all as it required much diplomacy
to have them thrown in, for the gentleman who sold to
me was staunch. Besides all this, there is a great deal
more forest than I have any need for; or to be plain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
whole estate is one impassable jungle, which must be cut
down and through at considerable expense. Then the
house has to be built; and then (as a climax) we may have
to stand a siege in it in the next native war.</p>

<p>I do feel as if I was a coward and a traitor to desert
my friends; only, my dear lady, you know what a miserable
corrhyzal (is that how it is spelt?) creature I was at
home: and here I have some real health, I can walk, I
can ride, I can stand some exposure, I am up with the
sun, I have a real enjoyment of the world and of myself;
it would be hard to go back again to England and to
bed; and I think it would be very silly. I am sure it
would; and yet I feel shame, and I know I am not writing
like myself. I wish you knew how much I admired you,
and when I think of those I must leave, how early a place
your name occupies. I have not had the pleasure to
know you very long; and yet I feel as if my leaving
England were a special treachery to you, and my leaving
you a treachery to myself. I will only ask you to try to
forgive me: for I am sure I will never quite forgive myself.
Somebody might write to me in the care of R. Towns
&amp; Co., Sydney, New South Wales, to tell me if you can
forgive. But you will do quite right if you cannot. Only
let me come and see you when we do return, or it will be
a lame home-coming.</p>

<p>My wife suffered a good deal in our last, somewhat
arduous voyage; all our party indeed suffered except
myself. Fanny is now better but she is still no very famous
success in the way of health.</p>

<p>All the while I have been writing, I have had another
matter in my eye; of which I scarce like to speak: You
know of course that I am thinking of Sir Percy and his
widow. The news has reached me in the shape of a newspaper
cutting, I have no particulars. He had a sweet,
original nature; I think I liked him better than ever I
should have liked his father; I am sorry he was always
a little afraid of me; if I had had more chance, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
have liked me too, we had so much in common, and I
valued so much his fine soul, as honest as a dog&rsquo;s, and
the romance of him, which was like a dog&rsquo;s too, and like
a poet&rsquo;s at the same time. If he had not been Shelley&rsquo;s
son, people would have thought more of him; and yet he
was the better of the two, bar verses.</p>

<p>Please tell my dear Ida and Una that we think much
of them, as well as of your dear self, and believe me, in
words which you once allowed me to use (and I was very
much affected when you did so), your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Dr. Scott</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This gentleman is the physician to whose assiduous care and
kindness, as recorded in the dedication to <i>Underwoods</i>, Stevenson
owed so much during his invalid years at Bournemouth.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Apia, Samoa, January 20th,</i> 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SCOTT</span>,&mdash;Shameful indeed that you should
not have heard of me before! I have now been some
twenty months in the South Seas, and am (up to date)
a person whom you would scarce know. I think nothing
of long walks and rides: I was four hours and a half gone
the other day, partly riding, partly climbing up a steep
ravine. I have stood a six months&rsquo; voyage on a copra
schooner with about three months ashore on coral atolls,
which means (except for cocoanuts to drink) no change
whatever from ship&rsquo;s food. My wife suffered badly&mdash;it
was too rough a business altogether&mdash;Lloyd suffered&mdash;and,
in short, I was the only one of the party who &ldquo;kept my
end up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am so pleased with this climate that I have decided
to settle; have even purchased a piece of land from three
to four hundred acres, I know not which till the survey
is completed, and shall only return next summer to wind
up my affairs in England; thenceforth I mean to be a
subject of the High Commissioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span></p>

<p>Now you would have gone longer yet without news of
your truant patient, but that I have a medical discovery
to communicate. I find I can (almost immediately) fight
off a cold with liquid extract of coca; two or (if obstinate)
three teaspoonfuls in the day for a variable period of from
one to five days sees the cold generally to the door. I
find it at once produces a glow, stops rigour, and though
it makes one very uncomfortable, prevents the advance
of the disease. Hearing of this influenza, it occurred to
me that this might prove remedial; and perhaps a stronger
exhibition&mdash;injections of cocaine, for instance&mdash;still better.</p>

<p>If on my return I find myself let in for this epidemic,
which seems highly calculated to nip me in the bud, I
shall feel very much inclined to make the experiment.
See what a gulf you may save me from if you shall have
previously made it on <i>anima vili</i>, on some less important
sufferer, and shall have found it worse than useless.</p>

<p>How is Miss Boodle and her family? Greeting to your
brother and all friends in Bournemouth.&mdash;Yours very
sincerely,</p>

<p>After a stay of four or five weeks at Apia, during which he had
fallen more and more in love with Samoa and the Samoans, Stevenson

written during the passage. I again print in their original place

going to see her. Thank you for that: you can in no
way more touch and serve me.... Ay, ay, it is sad to

in Apemama, I wrote two copies of verse about Edinburgh

<p>They&rsquo;re pretty second-rate, but felt. I can&rsquo;t be bothered

<p>I have bought 314&frac12; acres of beautiful land in the bush
behind Apia; when we get the house built, the garden
laid, and cattle in the place, it will be something to fall
back on for shelter and food; and if the island could
stumble into political quiet, it is conceivable it might even
bring a little income.... We range from 600 to 1500
feet, have five streams, waterfalls, precipices, profound
ravines, rich tablelands, fifty head of cattle on the ground
(if any one could catch them), a great view of forest, sea,
mountains, the warships in the haven: really a noble
place. Some day you are to take a long holiday and come
and see us: it has been all planned.</p>

<p>With all these irons in the fire, and cloudy prospects,
you may be sure I was pleased to hear a good account
of business. I believed <i>The Master</i> was a sure card: I
wonder why Henley thinks it grimy; grim it is, God
knows, but sure not grimy, else I am the more deceived.
I am sorry he did not care for it; I place it on the
line with <i>Kidnapped</i> myself. We&rsquo;ll see as time goes on

<p class="rt"><i>S.S.</i> LÃ¼beck [<i>between Apia and Sydney,

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;I desire nothing better than
to continue my relation with the Magazine, to which it
pleases me to hear I have been useful. The only thing
I have ready is the enclosed barbaric piece. As soon as
I have arrived in Sydney I shall send you some photographs,
a portrait of Tembinoka, perhaps a view of the
palace or of the &ldquo;matted men&rdquo; at their singing; also
T.&rsquo;s flag, which my wife designed for him: in a word, what
I can do best for you. It will be thus a foretaste of my
book of travels. I shall ask you to let me have, if I wish
it, the use of the plates made, and to make up a little
tract of the verses and illustrations, of which you might
send six copies to H.M. Tembinoka, King of Apemama,
via Butaritari, Gilbert Islands. It might be best to send
it by Crawford &amp; Co., S.F. There is no postal service; and
schooners must take it, how they may and when. Perhaps
some such note as this might be prefixed:</p>

<p><i>At my departure from the island of Apemama, for which
you will look in vain in most atlases, the king and I agreed,
since we both set up to be in the poetical way, that we should
celebrate our separation in verse. Whether or not his majesty
has been true to his bargain, the laggard posts of the Pacific
may perhaps inform me in six months, perhaps not before
a year. The following lines represent my part of the contract,
and it is hoped, by their pictures of strange manners, they
may entertain a civilised audience. Nothing throughout has
been invented or exaggerated; the lady herein referred to as
the author&rsquo;s Muse, has confined herself to stringing into
rhyme facts and legends that I saw or heard during two
months&rsquo; residence upon the island.</i></p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="pt1">You will have received from me a letter about <i>The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
Wrecker</i>. No doubt it is a new experiment for me, being
disguised so much as a study of manners, and the interest
turning on a mystery of the detective sort. I think there
need be no hesitation about beginning it in the fall of
the year. Lloyd has nearly finished his part, and I shall
hope to send you very soon the MS. of about the first
four-sevenths. At the same time, I have been employing
myself in Samoa, collecting facts about the recent war;
and I propose to write almost at once and to publish
shortly a small volume, called I know not what&mdash;the War
in Samoa, the Samoa Trouble, an Island War, the War
of the Three Consuls, I know not&mdash;perhaps you can suggest.
It was meant to be a part of my travel book; but material
has accumulated on my hands until I see myself forced
into volume form, and I hope it may be of use, if it come
soon. I have a few photographs of the war, which will
do for illustrations. It is conceivable you might wish to
handle this in the Magazine, although I am inclined to
think you won&rsquo;t, and to agree with you. But if you think
otherwise, there it is. The travel letters (fifty of them)
are already contracted for in papers; these I was quite
bound to let M&rsquo;Clure handle, as the idea was of his suggestion,
and I always felt a little sore as to one trick I played
him in the matter of the end-papers. The war-volume
will contain some very interesting and picturesque details:
more I can&rsquo;t promise for it. Of course the fifty newspaper
letters will be simply patches chosen from the travel
volume (or volumes) as it gets written,</p>

<p>But you see I have in hand:&mdash;</p>

you have <i>The Wrecker</i> and the War volume, if you like
either&mdash;or both&mdash;to keep my name in the Magazine.</p>

<p>It begins to look as if I should not be able to get any
more ballads done this somewhile. I know the book
would sell better if it were all ballads; and yet I am
growing half tempted to fill up with some other verses.
A good few are connected with my voyage, such as the
&ldquo;Home of Tembinoka&rdquo; sent herewith, and would have
a sort of slight affinity to the <i>South Sea Ballads</i>. You

try just now; and I thought at any rate you had better
see it, set it up if you think well, and let me have a proof;
so, at least, we shall get the bulk of it straight. I have
spared you TeÃ±koruti, Tembaitake, Tembinatake, and
other barbarous names, because I thought the dentists
in the States had work enough without my assistance;
but my chief&rsquo;s name is <span class="sc">Tembinoka</span>, pronounced, according
to the present quite modern habit in the Gilberts,
Tembinok&rsquo;. Compare in the margin Tengkorootch; a
singular new trick, setting at defiance all South Sea analogy,
for nowhere else do they show even the ability, far less
the will, to end a word upon a consonant. Loia is Lloyd&rsquo;s
name, ship becomes shipÃ©, teapot tipotÃ©, etc. Our admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
friend Herman Melville, of whom, since I could judge,
I have thought more than ever, had no ear for languages
whatever: his Hapar tribe should be Hapaa, etc.</p>

<p>But this is of no interest to you: suffice it, you see
how I am as usual up to the neck in projects, and really
all likely bairns this time. When will this activity cease?
Too soon for me, I dare to say.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>February 4th,</i> 1890, S.S. LÃ¼beck.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR JAMES PAYN</span>,&mdash;In virtue of confessions in
your last, you would at the present moment, if you were
along of me, be sick; and I will ask you to receive that
as an excuse for my hand of write. Excuse a plain seaman
if he regards with scorn the likes of you pore land-lubbers
ashore now. (Reference to nautical ditty.) Which
I may however be allowed to add that when eight months&rsquo;
mail was laid by my side one evening in Apia, and my
wife and I sat up the most of the night to peruse the same&mdash;(precious
indisposed we were next day in consequence)&mdash;no
letter, out of so many, more appealed to our hearts
than one from the pore, stick-in-the-mud, land-lubbering,
common (or garden) Londoner, James Payn. Thank you
for it; my wife says, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I see him when we get back
to London?&rdquo; I have told her the thing appeared to me
within the spear of practical politix. (Why can&rsquo;t I spell
and write like an honest, sober, god-fearing litry gent?
I think it&rsquo;s the motion of the ship.) Here I was interrupted
to play chess with the chief engineer; as I grow
old, I prefer the &ldquo;athletic sport of cribbage,&rdquo; of which (I
am sure I misquote) I have just been reading in your
delightful <i>Literary Recollections</i>. How you skim along,
you and Andrew Lang (different as you are), and yet the
only two who can keep a fellow smiling every page, and
ever and again laughing out loud. I joke wi&rsquo; deeficulty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
I believe; I am not funny; and when I am, Mrs. Oliphant
says I&rsquo;m vulgar, and somebody else says (in Latin) that
I&rsquo;m a whore, which seems harsh and even uncalled for:
I shall stick to weepers; a 5s. weeper, 2s. 6d. laugher,
1s. shocker.</p>

<p>My dear sir, I grow more and more idiotic; I cannot
even feign sanity. Some time in the month of June a
stalwart weather-beaten man, evidently of seafaring antecedents,
shall be observed wending his way between the
AthenÃ¦um Club and Waterloo Place. Arrived off No. 17,
he shall be observed to bring his head sharply to the
wind, and tack into the outer haven. &ldquo;Captain Payn in
the harbour?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir. What ship?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Barquentin
R. L. S., nine hundred and odd days out from the
port of Bournemouth, homeward bound, with yarns and
curiosities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who was it said, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t speak of it!&rdquo;
about Scott and his tears? He knew what he was saying.
The fear of that hour is the skeleton in all our cupboards;
that hour when the pastime and the livelihood go together;
and&mdash;I am getting hard of hearing myself; a pore young
child of forty, but new come frae my Mammy, O!</p>

<p>Excuse these follies, and accept the expression of all
my regards.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p>Written while he was still in a white heat of indignation on behalf

been a private one not meant for publicity, and later came to think
he might have struck as effectively on behalf of Damien without
striking so fiercely against Dr. Hyde (see below, p. 404). &ldquo;Damon&rdquo;

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Union Club, Sydney, March</i> 5, 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I understand the family keeps
you somewhat informed. For myself I am in such a
whirl of work and society, I can ill spare a moment. My
health is excellent and has been here tried by abominable
wet weather, and (what&rsquo;s waur) dinners and lunches. As
this is like to be our metropolis, I have tried to lay myself
out to be sociable with an eye to yoursel&rsquo;. Several niceish
people have turned up: Fanny has an evening, but she
is about at the end of the virtuous effort, and shrinks
from the approach of any fellow creature.</p>

<p>Have you seen Hyde&rsquo;s (Dr. not Mr.) letter about
Damien? That has been one of my concerns; I have
an answer in the press; and have just written a difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
letter to Damon trying to prepare him for what (I fear)
must be to him extremely painful. The answer is to
come out as a pamphlet; of which I make of course a
present to the publisher. I am not a cannibal, I would
not eat the flesh of Dr. Hyde,&mdash;and it is conceivable it
will make a noise in Honolulu. I have struck as hard
as I knew how; nor do I think my answer can fail to
do away (in the minds of all who see it) with the effect
of Hyde&rsquo;s incredible and really villainous production.

<p>Stevenson had not been long at Sydney&mdash;just long enough to

one of his old bad attacks of fever and hemorrhage from the lungs.
It was this experience which finally determined him to settle for

a blooming prisoner here in the club, and indeed in my

looked, and how reasonably well I stood.... I am sure
I shall never come back home except to die; I may do it,
but shall always think of the move as suicidal, unless a
great change comes over me, of which as yet I see no
symptom. This visit to Sydney has smashed me handsomely;
and yet I made myself a prisoner here in the

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>To try and recover from the effects of his illness at Sydney,
Stevenson determined to take another voyage; and started accordingly
in April with his party on a trading steamer, the <i>Janet Nicoll</i>,
which took him by a long and devious course among many groups of
islands that he had not yet visited, returning to Sydney in August
by way of New Caledonia. On the first night out of Auckland
harbour the voyage nearly came to a premature end through the
blowing up of some trade fireworks, or materials for fireworks, which
had been packed in the stateroom.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>S.S.</i> Janet Nicoll, <i>off Upolu</i> [<i>Spring</i> 1890].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAREST COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I was sharply ill at Sydney, cut
off, right out of bed, in this steamer on a fresh island
cruise, and have already reaped the benefit. We are
excellently found this time, on a spacious vessel, with an
excellent table; the captain, supercargo, our one fellow-passenger,
etc., very nice; and the charterer, Mr. Henderson,
the very man I could have chosen. The truth is, I fear,
this life is the only one that suits me; so long as I cruise
in the South Seas, I shall be well and happy&mdash;alas, no,
I do not mean that, and <i>absit omen</i>!&mdash;I mean that, so soon
as I cease from cruising, the nerves are strained, the decline
commences, and I steer slowly but surely back to bedward.
We left Sydney, had a cruel rough passage to
Auckland, for the <i>Janet</i> is the worst roller I was ever aboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
of. I was confined to my cabin, ports closed, self shied
out of the berth, stomach (pampered till the day I left on
a diet of perpetual egg-nogg) revolted at ship&rsquo;s food and
ship eating, in a frowsy bunk, clinging with one hand to
the plate, with the other to the glass, and using the knife
and fork (except at intervals) with the eyelid. No matter:
I picked up hand over hand. After a day in Auckland, we
set sail again; were blown up in the main cabin with
calcium fires, as we left the bay. Let no man say I am
unscientific: when I ran, on the alert, out of my stateroom,
and found the main cabin incarnadined with the
glow of the last scene of a pantomime, I stopped dead:
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This ship is on fire, I see that;
but why a pantomime?&rdquo; And I stood and reasoned the
point, until my head was so muddled with the fumes that
I could not find the companion. A few seconds later, the
captain had to enter crawling on his belly, and took days
to recover (if he has recovered) from the fumes. By
singular good fortune, we got the hose down in time and
saved the ship, but Lloyd lost most of his clothes and
a great part of our photographs was destroyed. Fanny
saw the native sailors tossing overboard a blazing trunk;
she stopped them in time, and behold, it contained my
manuscripts. Thereafter we had three (or two) days fine
weather: then got into a gale of wind, with rain and a
vexatious sea. As we drew into our anchorage in a bight
of Savage Island, a man ashore told me afterwards the
sight of the <i>Janet Nicoll</i> made him sick; and indeed it
was rough play, though nothing to the night before. All
through this gale I worked four to six hours per diem
spearing the ink-bottle like a flying fish, and holding my
papers together as I might. For, of all things, what I was at
was history&mdash;the Samoan business&mdash;and I had to turn
from one to another of these piles of manuscript notes,
and from one page to another in each, until I should
have found employment for the hands of Briareus. All
the same, this history is a godsend for a voyage; I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
put in time, getting events co-ordinated and the narrative
distributed, when my much-heaving numskull would be
incapable of finish or fine style. At Savage we met the
missionary barque <i>John Williams</i>. I tell you it was a
great day for Savage Island: the path up the cliffs was
crowded with gay islandresses (I like that feminine plural)
who wrapped me in their embraces, and picked my pockets
of all my tobacco, with a manner which a touch would
have made revolting, but as it was, was simply charming,
like the Golden Age. One pretty, little, stalwart minx,
with a red flower behind her ear, had searched me with
extraordinary zeal; and when, soon after, I missed my
matches, I accused her (she still following us) of being
the thief. After some delay, and with a subtle smile,
she produced the box, gave me <i>one match</i>, and put the
rest away again. Too tired to add more.&mdash;Your most
affectionate</p>

<p class="to">To E. L. Burlingame</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The idea here discussed of a further series of essays to be contributed
to Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine was never carried out.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>S.S.</i> Janet Nicoll, <i>off Peru Island, Kingsmills<br />
Group, July 13th,</i> &rsquo;90.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;I am moved to write to you
in the matter of the end papers. I am somewhat tempted
to begin them again. Follow the reasons <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. I must say I feel as if something in the nature of
the end paper were a desirable finish to the number, and
that the substitutes of occasional essays by occasional
contributors somehow fail to fill the bill. Should you
differ with me on this point, no more is to be said. And
what follows must be regarded as lost words.</p>

<p>2nd. I am rather taken with the idea of continuing
the work. For instance, should you have no distaste for
papers of the class called <i>Random Memories</i>, I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
enjoy continuing them (of course at intervals), and when
they were done I have an idea they might make a readable
book. On the other hand, I believe a greater freedom of
choice might be taken, the subjects more varied and more
briefly treated, in somewhat approaching the manner of
Andrew Lang in the <i>Sign of the Ship</i>; it being well understood
that the broken sticks<a name="FnAnchor_34" id="FnAnchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> method is one not very
suitable (as Colonel Burke would say) to my genius, and
not very likely to be pushed far in my practice. Upon
this point I wish you to condense your massive brain. In
the last lot I was promised, and I fondly expected to
receive, a vast amount of assistance from intelligent and
genial correspondents. I assure you, I never had a scratch
of a pen from any one above the level of a village idiot,
except once, when a lady sowed my head full of grey
hairs by announcing that she was going to direct her life
in future by my counsels. Will the correspondents be
more copious and less irrelevant in the future? Suppose
that to be the case, will they be of any use to me in my
place of exile? Is it possible for a man in Samoa to be
in touch with the great heart of the People? And is it
not perhaps a mere folly to attempt, from so hopeless a
distance, anything so delicate as a series of papers? Upon
these points, perpend, and give me the results of your
perpensions.</p>

<p>3rd. The emolument would be agreeable to your
humble servant.</p>

<p>I have now stated all the <i>pros</i>, and the most of the
<i>cons</i> are come in by the way. There follows, however, one
immense Con (with a capital &ldquo;C&rdquo;), which I beg you to
consider particularly. I fear that, to be of any use for
your magazine, these papers should begin with the beginning
of a volume. Even supposing my hands were free,
this would be now impossible for next year. You have
to consider whether, supposing you have no other objection,
it would be worth while to begin the series in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
middle of a volume, or desirable to delay the whole matter
until the beginning of another year.</p>

<p>Now supposing that the <i>cons</i> have it, and you refuse
my offer, let me make another proposal, which you will
be very inclined to refuse at the first off-go, but which I
really believe might in time come to something. You
know how the penny papers have their answers to correspondents.
Why not do something of the same kind for
the &ldquo;culchawed&rdquo;? Why not get men like Stimson,
Brownell, Professor James, Goldwin Smith, and others
who will occur to you more readily than to me, to put and
to answer a series of questions of intellectual and general
interest, until at last you should have established a certain
standard of matter to be discussed in this part of the
Magazine?</p>

<p>I want you to get me bound volumes of the Magazine
from its start. The Lord knows I have had enough copies;
where they are I know not. A wandering author gathers
no magazines.</p>

<p><i>The Wrecker</i> is in no forrader state than in last reports.
I have indeed got to a period when I cannot well go on
until I can refresh myself on the proofs of the beginning.
My respected collaborator, who handles the machine
which is now addressing you, has indeed carried his
labours farther, but not, I am led to understand, with
what we used to call a blessing; at least, I have been
refused a sight of his latest labours. However, there is
plenty of time ahead, and I feel no anxiety about the tale,
except that it may meet with your approval.</p>

<p>All this voyage I have been busy over my <i>Travels</i>,
which, given a very high temperature and the saloon of a
steamer usually going before the wind, and with the cabins
in front of the engines, has come very near to prostrating
me altogether. You will therefore understand that there
are no more poems. I wonder whether there are already
enough, and whether you think that such a volume would
be worth the publishing? I shall hope to find in Sydney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
some expression of your opinion on this point. Living as
I do among&mdash;not the most cultured of mankind (&ldquo;splendidly
educated and perfect gentlemen when sober&rdquo;)&mdash;I attach
a growing importance to friendly criticisms from yourself.</p>

<p>I believe that this is the most of our business. As for
my health, I got over my cold in a fine style, but have
not been very well of late. To my unaffected annoyance,
the blood-spitting has started again. I find the heat of
a steamer decidedly wearing and trying in these latitudes,
and I am inclined to think the superior expedition rather
dearly paid for. Still, the fact that one does not even
remark the coming of a squall, nor feel relief on its departure,
is a mercy not to be acknowledged without gratitude.
The rest of the family seem to be doing fairly well; both
seem less run down than they were on the <i>Equator</i>, and
Mrs. Stevenson very much less so. We have now been
three months away, have visited about thirty-five islands,
many of which were novel to us, and some extremely
entertaining; some also were old acquaintances, and
pleasant to revisit. In the meantime, we have really a
capital time aboard ship, in the most pleasant and interesting
society, and with (considering the length and nature
of the voyage) an excellent table. Please remember us all
to Mr. Scribner, the young chieftain of the house, and the
lady, whose health I trust is better. To Mrs. Burlingame
we all desire to be remembered, and I hope you will give
our news to Low, St. Gaudens, Faxon, and others of the
faithful in the city. I shall probably return to Samoa
direct, having given up all idea of returning to civilisation
in the meanwhile. There, on my ancestral acres, which
I purchased six months ago from a blind Scots blacksmith,
you will please address me until further notice. The
name of the ancestral acres is going to be Vailima; but as
at the present moment nobody else knows the name, except
myself and the co-patentees, it will be safer, if less ambitious,
to address R. L. S., Apia, Samoa. The ancestral acres run
to upwards of three hundred; they enjoy the ministrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
of five streams, whence the name. They are all at the
present moment under a trackless covering of magnificent
forest, which would be worth a great deal if it grew beside
a railway terminus. To me, as it stands, it represents a
handsome deficit. Obliging natives from the Cannibal
Islands are now cutting it down at my expense. You
would be able to run your magazine to much greater
advantage if the terms of authors were on the same scale
with those of my cannibals. We have also a house about
the size of a manufacturer&rsquo;s lodge. &rsquo;Tis but the egg of
the future palace, over the details of which on paper
Mrs. Stevenson and I have already shed real tears; what
it will be when it comes to paying for it, I leave you
to imagine. But if it can only be built as now intended,
it will be with genuine satisfaction and a growunded pride
that I shall welcome you at the steps of my Old Colonial
Home, when you land from the steamer on a long-merited
holiday. I speak much at my ease; yet I do not know,
I may be now an outlaw, a bankrupt, the abhorred of all
good men. I do not know, you probably do. Has Hyde<a name="FnAnchor_35" id="FnAnchor_35" href="#Footnote_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a>
turned upon me? Have I fallen, like Danvers Carew?</p>

<p>It is suggested to me that you might like to know what
will be my future society. Three consuls, all at loggerheads
with one another, or at the best in a clique of two
against one; three different sects of missionaries, not
upon the best of terms; and the Catholics and Protestants
in a condition of unhealable ill-feeling as to whether a
wooden drum ought or ought not to be beaten to announce
the time of school. The native population, very genteel,
very songful, very agreeable, very good-looking, chronically
spoiling for a fight (a circumstance not to be entirely
neglected in the design of the palace). As for the white
population of (technically, &ldquo;The Beach&rdquo;), I don&rsquo;t suppose
it is possible for any person not thoroughly conversant
with the South Seas to form the smallest conception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
such a society, with its grog-shops, its apparently unemployed
hangers-on, its merchants of all degrees of respectability
and the reverse. The paper, of which I must really
send you a copy&mdash;if yours were really a live magazine, you
would have an exchange with the editor: I assure you, it
has of late contained a great deal of matter about one of
your contributors&mdash;rejoices in the name of Samoa Times
and South Sea Advertiser. The advertisements in the
Advertiser are permanent, being simply subsidies for its
existence. A dashing warfare of newspaper correspondence
goes on between the various residents, who are rather fond
of recurring to one another&rsquo;s antecedents. But when all
is said, there are a lot of very nice, pleasant people, and I
don&rsquo;t know that Apia is very much worse than half a
hundred towns that I could name.</p>

<p>As above indicated, on the way between Samoa and Sydney
Stevenson left the <i>Janet Nicoll</i> for a week&rsquo;s stay in New Caledonia,
during which he was hospitably received by the French officials.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel Sebastopol, Noumea, August</i> 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;I have stayed here a week while
Lloyd and my wife continue to voyage in the <i>Janet Nicoll</i>;
this I did, partly to see the convict system, partly to
shorten my stay in the extreme cold&mdash;hear me with my
extreme! <i>moi qui suis originaire d&rsquo;Edimbourg</i>&mdash;of Sydney
at this season. I am feeling very seedy, utterly fatigued
and overborne with sleep. I have a fine old gentleman
of a doctor, who attends and cheers and entertains, if he
does not cure me; but even with his ministrations I am
almost incapable of the exertion sufficient for this letter;
and I am really, as I write, falling down with sleep. What
is necessary to say, I must try to say shortly. Lloyd goes
to clear out our establishments: pray keep him in funds,
if I have any; if I have not, pray try to raise them. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
is the idea: to install ourselves, at the risk of bankruptcy,
in Samoa. It is not the least likely it will pay (although it
may); but it is almost certain it will support life, with
very few external expenses. If I die, it will be an endowment
for the survivors, at least for my wife and Lloyd;
and my mother, who might prefer to go home, has her
own. Hence I believe I shall do well to hurry my installation.
The letters are already in part done; in part done
is a novel for Scribner; in the course of the next twelve
months I should receive a considerable amount of money.
I am aware I had intended to pay back to my capital
some of this. I am now of opinion I should act foolishly.
Better to build the house and have a roof and farm of my
own; and thereafter, with a livelihood assured, save and
repay.... There is my livelihood, all but books and
wine, ready in a nutshell; and it ought to be more easy
to save and to repay afterwards. Excellent, say you, but
will you save and will you repay? I do not know, said
the Bell of Old Bow.... It seems clear to me....
The deuce of the affair is that I do not know when I shall
see you and Colvin. I guess you will have to come and
see me: many a time already we have arranged the details
of your visit in the yet unbuilt house on the mountain.
I shall be able to get decent wine from Noumea. We
shall be able to give you a decent welcome, and talk of
old days. <i>Apropos</i> of old days, do you remember still
the phrase we heard in Waterloo Place? I believe you
made a piece for the piano on that phrase. Pray, if you
remember it, send it me in your next. If you find it
impossible to write correctly, send it me <i>Ã  la rÃ©citative</i>,
and indicate the accents. Do you feel (you must) how
strangely heavy and stupid I am? I must at last give
up and go sleep; I am simply a rag.</p>

inconceivable. Never mind; dress clothes, &ldquo;which
nobody can deny&rdquo;; and the officials have been all so civil
that I liked neither to refuse nor to appear in mufti.
Bad dress clothes only prove you are a grisly ass; no
dress clothes, even when explained, indicate a want of
respect. I wish you were here with me to help me dress
in this wild raiment, and to accompany me to M. Noel-Pardon&rsquo;s.
I cannot say what I would give if there came
a knock now at the door and you came in. I guess Noel-Pardon
would go begging, and we might burn the fr. 200
dress clothes in the back garden for a bonfire; or what
would be yet more expensive and more humorous, get
them once more expanded to fit you, and when that was
done, a second time cut down for my gossamer dimensions.</p>

<p>I hope you never forget to remember me to your father,
who has always a place in my heart, as I hope I have a
little in his. His kindness helped me infinitely when you
and I were young; I recall it with gratitude and affection
in this town of convicts at the world&rsquo;s end. There are
very few things, my dear Charles, worth mention: on a
retrospect of life, the day&rsquo;s flash and colour, one day with
another, flames, dazzles, and puts to sleep; and when the
days are gone, like a fast-flying thaumatrope, they make
but a single pattern. Only a few things stand out; and
among these&mdash;most plainly to me&mdash;Rutland Square.&mdash;Ever,
my dear Charles, your affectionate friend,</p>

The next letter is in acknowledgment of proofs received from
Messrs. Scribner of a proposed volume of verse to contain, besides
<i>Ticonderoga</i> and the two ballads on Marquesan and Tahitian legends,
a number of the other miscellaneous verses which he had written
in the course of his travels. In the end, the ballads only stood for
publication at this time; the other verses were reserved, and have
been posthumously published under the title <i>Songs of Travel</i>.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BURLINGAME</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ballads.</i></p>

<p>The deuce is in this volume. It has cost me more
botheration and dubiety than any other I ever took in
hand. On one thing my mind is made up: the verses at
the end have no business there, and throw them down.
Many of them are bad, many of the rest want nine years&rsquo;
keeping, and the remainder are not relevant&mdash;throw them
down; some I never want to hear of more, others will
grow in time towards decent items in a second <i>Underwoods</i>&mdash;and
in the meanwhile, down with them! At the same
time, I have a sneaking idea the ballads are not altogether
without merit&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re poetry, but they&rsquo;re
good narrative, or I&rsquo;m deceived. (You&rsquo;ve never said one
word about them, from which I astutely gather you are
dead set against: &ldquo;he was a diplomatic man&rdquo;&mdash;extract
from epitaph of E. L. B.&mdash;&ldquo;and remained on good terms
with Minor Poets.&rdquo;) You will have to judge: one of the
Gladstonian trinity of paths must be chosen. (1st) Either
publish the five ballads, such as they are, in a volume
called <i>Ballads</i>; in which case pray send sheets at once
to Chatto and Windus. Or (2nd) write and tell me you
think the book too small, and I&rsquo;ll try and get into the
mood to do some more. Or (3rd) write and tell me the
whole thing is a blooming illusion; in which case draw
off some twenty copies for my private entertainment, and
charge me with the expense of the whole dream.</p>

<p>In the matter of rhyme no man can judge himself; I
am at the world&rsquo;s end, have no one to consult, and my
publisher holds his tongue. I call it unfair and almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
unmanly. I do indeed begin to be filled with animosity;
Lord, wait till you see the continuation of <i>The Wrecker</i>,
when I introduce some New York publishers.... It&rsquo;s a
good scene; the quantities you drink and the really
hideous language you are represented as employing may
perhaps cause you one tithe of the pain you have inflicted
by your silence on, sir, The Poetaster,</p>

<p class="pt1">Lloyd is off home; my wife and I dwell sundered: she

<p class="to">To Henry James</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Union Club, Sydney, August</i> 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENRY JAMES</span>,&mdash;Kipling is too clever to live.
The <i>BÃªte Humaine</i><a name="FnAnchor_36" id="FnAnchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> I had already perused in Noumea,
listening the while to the strains of the convict band.
He is a Beast; but not human, and, to be frank, not very
interesting. &ldquo;Nervous maladies: the homicidal ward,&rdquo;
would be the better name: O, this game gets very tedious.</p>

<p>Your two long and kind letters have helped to entertain
the old familiar sickbed. So has a book called <i>The
Bondman</i>, by Hall Caine; I wish you would look at it.
I am not half-way through yet. Read the book, and
communicate your views. Hall Caine, by the way, appears
to take Hugo&rsquo;s view of History and Chronology (<i>Later</i>;
the book doesn&rsquo;t keep up; it gets very wild.)</p>

<p>I must tell you plainly&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell Colvin&mdash;I do not
think I shall come to England more than once, and then
it&rsquo;ll be to die. Health I enjoy in the tropics; even here,
which they call sub- or semi-tropical, I come only to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
catch cold. I have not been out since my arrival; live
here in a nice bedroom by the fireside, and read books
and letters from Henry James, and send out to get his
<i>Tragic Muse</i>, only to be told they can&rsquo;t be had as yet in
Sydney, and have altogether a placid time. But I can&rsquo;t
go out! The thermometer was nearly down to 50Â° the
other day&mdash;no temperature for me, Mr. James: how
should I do in England? I fear not at all. Am I very
sorry? I am sorry about seven or eight people in England,
and one or two in the States. And outside of that, I
simply prefer Samoa. These are the words of honesty and
soberness. (I am fasting from all but sin, coughing, <i>The
Bondman</i>, a couple of eggs and a cup of tea.) I was
never fond of towns, houses, society, or (it seems) civilisation.
Nor yet it seems was I ever very fond of (what is
technically called) God&rsquo;s green earth. The sea, islands,
the islanders, the island life and climate, make and keep
me truly happier. These last two years I have been much
at sea, and I have <i>never wearied</i>; sometimes I have indeed
grown impatient for some destination; more often I was
sorry that the voyage drew so early to an end; and never
once did I lose my fidelity to blue water and a ship. It is
plain, then, that for me my exile to the place of schooners
and islands can be in no sense regarded as a calamity.</p>

<p>Good-bye just now: I must take a turn at my proofs.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Even my wife has weakened about the sea.
She wearied, the last time we were ashore, to get afloat
again.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To Marcel Schwob</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Union Club, Sydney, August 19th,</i> 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MR. SCHWOB</span>,&mdash;<i>Mais, alors, vous avez tous les
bonheurs, vous!</i> More about Villon; it seems incredible:
when it is put in order, pray send it me.</p>

<p>You wish to translate the <i>Black Arrow</i>: dear sir, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
are hereby authorised; but I warn you, I do not like the
work. Ah, if you, who know so well both tongues, and
have taste and instruction&mdash;if you would but take a fancy
to translate a book of mine that I myself admired&mdash;for
we sometimes admire our own&mdash;or I do&mdash;with what satisfaction
would the authority be granted! But these things
are too much to expect. <i>Vous ne dÃ©testez pas alors mes
bonnes femmes? moi, je les dÃ©teste.</i> I have never pleased
myself with any women of mine save two character parts,
one of only a few lines&mdash;the Countess of Rosen, and Madame
Desprez in the <i>Treasure of Franchard</i>.</p>

<p>I had indeed one moment of pride about my poor
<i>Black Arrow</i>: Dickon Crookback I did, and I do, think
is a spirited and possible figure. Shakespeare&rsquo;s&mdash;O, if we
can call that cocoon Shakespeare!&mdash;Shakespeare&rsquo;s is
spirited&mdash;one likes to see the untaught athlete butting
against the adamantine ramparts of human nature, head
down, breech up; it reminds us how trivial we are to-day,
and what safety resides in our triviality. For spirited it
may be, but O, sure not possible! I love Dumas and I
love Shakespeare: you will not mistake me when I say
that the Richard of the one reminds me of the Porthos
of the other; and if by any sacrifice of my own literary
baggage I could clear the <i>Vicomte de Bragelonne</i> of Porthos,
<i>Jekyll</i> might go, and the <i>Master</i>, and the <i>Black Arrow</i>, you
may be sure, and I should think my life not lost for mankind
if half a dozen more of my volumes must be thrown in.</p>

<p>The tone of your pleasant letters makes me egotistical;
you make me take myself too gravely. Comprehend how
I have lived much of my time in France, and loved your
country, and many of its people, and all the time was
learning that which your country has to teach&mdash;breathing
in rather that atmosphere of art which can only there be
breathed; and all the time knew&mdash;and raged to know&mdash;that
I might write with the pen of angels or of heroes,
and no Frenchman be the least the wiser! And now steps
in M. Marcel Schwob, writes me the most kind encouragement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>
and reads and understands, and is kind enough to
like my work.</p>

<p>I am just now overloaded with work. I have two
huge novels on hand&mdash;<i>The Wrecker</i> and the <i>Pearl Fisher</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_37" id="FnAnchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
in collaboration with my stepson: the latter, the <i>Pearl
Fisher</i>, I think highly of, for a black, ugly, trampling,
violent story, full of strange scenes and striking characters.
And then I am about waist-deep in my big book on the
South Seas: <i>the</i> big book on the South Seas it ought to
be, and shall. And besides, I have some verses in the
press, which, however, I hesitate to publish. For I am
no judge of my own verse; self-deception is there so facile.
All this and the cares of an impending settlement in Samoa
keep me very busy, and a cold (as usual) keeps me in bed.</p>

<p>Alas, I shall not have the pleasure to see you yet awhile,
if ever. You must be content to take me as a wandering
voice, and in the form of occasional letters from recondite
islands; and address me, if you will be good enough
to write, to Apia, Samoa. My stepson, Mr. Osbourne,
goes home meanwhile to arrange some affairs; it is not
unlikely he may go to Paris to arrange about the illustrations
to my South Seas; in which case I shall ask him
to call upon you, and give you some word of our outlandish
destinies. You will find him intelligent, I think;
and I am sure, if (<i>par hasard</i>) you should take any interest
in the islands, he will have much to tell you.&mdash;Herewith I
conclude, and am your obliged and interested correspondent,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p class="pt1"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The story you refer to has got lost in the post.</p>


<p class="to">To Andrew Lang</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Union Club, Sydney</i> [<i>August</i> 1890].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR LANG</span>,&mdash;I observed with a great deal of surprise
and interest that a controversy in which you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
been taking sides at home, in yellow London, hinges in
part at least on the Gilbert Islanders and their customs
in burial. Nearly six months of my life has been passed
in the group: I have revisited it but the other day; and
I make haste to tell you what I know. The upright stones&mdash;I
enclose you a photograph of one on Apemama&mdash;are
certainly connected with religion; I do not think they
are adored. They stand usually on the windward shore
of the islands, that is to say, apart from habitation (on
<i>enclosed islands</i>, where the people live on the sea side, I
do not know how it is, never having lived on one). I
gathered from Tembinoka, Rex Apemamae, that the
pillars were supposed to fortify the island from invasion:
spiritual martellos. I think he indicated they were connected
with the cult of Tenti&mdash;pronounce almost as chintz
in English, the <i>t</i> being explosive; but you must take this
with a grain of salt, for I knew no word of Gilbert Island;
and the King&rsquo;s English, although creditable, is rather
vigorous than exact. Now, here follows the point of
interest to you: such pillars, or standing stones, have no
connection with graves. The most elaborate grave that
I have ever seen in the group&mdash;to be certain&mdash;is in the
form of a <i>raised border</i> of gravel, usually strewn with
broken glass. One, of which I cannot be sure that it was
a grave, for I was told by one that it was, and by another
that it was not&mdash;consisted of a mound about breast high
in an excavated taro swamp, on the top of which was a
child&rsquo;s house, or rather <i>maniapa</i>&mdash;that is to say, shed, or
open house, such as is used in the group for social or
political gatherings&mdash;so small that only a child could
creep under its eaves. I have heard of another great
tomb on Apemama, which I did not see; but here again,
by all accounts, no sign of a standing stone. My report
would be&mdash;no connection between standing stones and
sepulture. I shall, however, send on the terms of the
problem to a highly intelligent resident trader, who knows
more than perhaps any one living, white or native, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
Gilbert group; and you shall have the result. In Samoa,
whither I return for good, I shall myself make inquiries;
up to now, I have neither seen nor heard of any standing
stones in that group.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p class="to">To Miss Adelaide Boodle</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Exactly what tale of doings in the garret at Skerryvore had been
related to Stevenson (in the character of Robin Lewison) by his
correspondent (in the character of Miss Green) cannot well be
gathered from this reply. But the letter is interesting as containing
the only mention of certain schemes of romance afterwards abandoned.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Union Club, Sydney, 1st September</i> 1890.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MISS BOODLE</span>,&mdash;I find you have been behaving
very ill: <i>been</i> very ill, in fact. I find this hard to forgive;
probably should not forgive it at all if Robin Lewison
had not been sick himself and a wretched sick-room
prisoner in this club for near a month. Well, the best and
bravest sometimes fail. But who is Miss Green? Don&rsquo;t
know her! I knew a lady of an exceedingly generous
and perfervid nature&mdash;worthy to be suspected of Scotch
blood for the pertervidness&mdash;equipped with a couple&mdash;perhaps
a brace sounds better English&mdash;of perfervid eyes&mdash;with
a certain graceful gaucherie of manner, almost like
a child&rsquo;s, and that is at once the highest point of gaucherie
and grace&mdash;a friend everybody I ever saw was delighted
to see come and sorry to see go. Yes, I knew that lady,
and can see her now. But who was Miss Green? There
is something amiss here. Either the Robin Lewisons
have been very shabbily treated, or&mdash;and this is the serious
part of the affair&mdash;somebody unknown to me has been
entrusted with the key of the Skerryvore garret. This
may go as far as the Old Bailey, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>But why should I gird at you or anybody, when the
truth is we are the most miserable sinners in the world?
For we are not coming home, I dare not. Even coming
to Sydney has made me quite ill, and back I go to Samoa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
whither please address&mdash;Apia, Samoa&mdash;(and remember it is
SÃ¡mÃ³-a, a spondee to begin with, or Sahmoa, if you prefer
that writing)&mdash;back I and my wife go to Samoa to live
on our landed estate with four black labour boys in a kind
of a sort of house, which Lloyd will describe to you. For
he has gone to England: receive him like a favour and a
piece of cake; he is our greeting to friends.</p>

<p>I paused here to put in the date on the first page. I
am precious nearly through my fortieth year, thinks I to
myself. Must be nearly as old as Miss Green, thinks I.
O, come! I exclaimed, not as bad as that! Some lees
of youth about the old remnant yet.</p>

<p>My amiable Miss Green, I beg you to give me news
of your health, and if it may be good news. And when
you shall have seen Lloyd, to tell me how his reports of
the South Seas and our new circumstances strike such an
awfully old person as yourself, and to tell me if you ever
received a letter I sent you from Hawaii. I remember
thinking&mdash;or remember remembering rather&mdash;it was (for
me) quite a long respectable communication. Also, you
might tell me if you got my war-whoop and scalping-knife
assault on <i>le nommÃ©</i> Hyde.</p>

<p>I ought not to forget to say your tale fetched me (Miss
Green) by its really vile probability. If we had met that
man in Honolulu he would have done it, and Miss Green
would have done it. Only, alas! there is no completed
novel lying in the garret: would there were! It should
be out to-morrow with the name to it, and relieve a kind
of tightness in the money market much deplored in our
immediate circle. To be sure (now I come to think of
it) there are some seven chapters of <i>The Great North Road</i>;
three, I think, of <i>Robin Run the Hedge</i>, given up when some
nefarious person pre-empted the name; and either there&mdash;or
somewhere else&mdash;likely New York&mdash;one chapter of
<i>David Balfour</i>, and five or six of the <i>Memoirs of Henry
Shovel</i>. That&rsquo;s all. But Lloyd and I have one-half of
The Wrecker in type, and a good part of <i>The Pearl Fisher</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
(O, a great and grisly tale that!) in MS. And I have a
projected, entirely planned love-story&mdash;everybody will
think it dreadfully improper, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;called <i>Cannonmills</i>.
And I&rsquo;ve a vague, rosy haze before me&mdash;a love-story
too, but not improper&mdash;called <i>The Rising Sun</i>. (It&rsquo;s
the name of the wayside inn where the story, or much of
the story, runs; but it&rsquo;s a kind of a pun: it means the
stirring up of a boy by falling in love, and how he rises
in the estimation of a girl who despised him, though she
liked him, and had befriended him; I really scarce see
beyond their childhood yet, but I want to go beyond,
and make each out-top the other by successions: it should
be pretty and true if I could do it.) Also I have my big
book, <i>The South Seas</i>, always with me, and a sair handfu&rsquo;&mdash;if
I may be allowed to speak Scotch to Miss Green&mdash;a
sair handfu&rsquo; it is likely to be. All this literary gossip I
bestow upon you <i>entre confrÃ¨res</i>, Miss Green, which is little
more than fair, Miss Green.</p>

<p>Allow me to remark that it is now half-past twelve
o&rsquo;clock of the living night; I should certainly be ashamed
of myself, and you also; for this is no time of the night
for Miss Green to be colloguing with a comparatively young
gentleman of forty. So with all the kindest wishes to
yourself, and all at Lostock, and all friends in Hants, or
over the borders in Dorset, I bring my folly to an end.
Please believe, even when I am silent, in my real affection;
I need not say the same for Fanny, more obdurately silent,
not less affectionate than I.&mdash;Your friend,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert&mdash;Robin Lewison.</p>

<p class="to">To Mrs. Charles Fairchild</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Union Club, Sydney</i> [<i>September</i> 1890].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD</span>,&mdash;I began a letter to you on
board the <i>Janet Nicoll</i> on my last cruise, wrote, I believe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
two sheets, and ruthlessly destroyed the flippant trash.
Your last has given me great pleasure and some pain, for
it increased the consciousness of my neglect. Now, this
must go to you, whatever it is like.</p>

<p>... It is always harshness that one regrets.... I
regret also my letter to Dr. Hyde. Yes, I do; I think
it was barbarously harsh; if I did it now, I would defend
Damien no less well, and give less pain to those who are
alive. These promptings of good-humour are not all
sound; the three times three, cheer boys cheer, and general
amiability business rests on a sneaking love of popularity,
the most insidious enemy of virtue. On the whole, it
was virtuous to defend Damien; but it was harsh to
strike so hard at Dr. Hyde. When I wrote the letter, I
believed he would bring an action, in which case I knew
I could be beggared. And as yet there has come no action;
the injured Doctor has contented himself up to now with
the (truly innocuous) vengeance of calling me a &ldquo;Bohemian
Crank,&rdquo; and I have deeply wounded one of his colleagues
whom I esteemed and liked.</p>

<p>Well, such is life. You are quite right; our civilisation
is a hollow fraud, all the fun of life is lost by it; all it
gains is that a larger number of persons can continue to
be contemporaneously unhappy on the surface of the
globe. O, unhappy!&mdash;there is a big word and a false&mdash;continue
to be not nearly&mdash;by about twenty per cent.&mdash;so
happy as they might be: that would be nearer the
mark.</p>

<p>When&mdash;observe that word, which I will write again and
larger&mdash;<span class="sc">WHEN</span> you come to see us in Samoa, you will see
for yourself a healthy and happy people.</p>

<p>You see, you are one of the very few of our friends
rich enough to come and see us; and when my house is
built, and the road is made, and we have enough fruit
planted and poultry and pigs raised, it is undeniable that
you must come&mdash;must is the word; that is the way in
which I speak to ladies. You and Fairchild, anyway&mdash;perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
my friend Blair&mdash;we&rsquo;ll arrange details in good
time. It will be the salvation of your souls, and make
you willing to die.</p>

<p>Let me tell you this: In &rsquo;74 or 5 there came to stay
with my father and mother a certain Mr. Seed, a prime
minister or something of New Zealand. He spotted what
my complaint was; told me that I had no business to
stay in Europe; that I should find all I cared for, and all
that was good for me, in the Navigator Islands; sat up
till four in the morning persuading me, demolishing my
scruples. And I resisted: I refused to go so far from my
father and mother. O, it was virtuous, and O, wasn&rsquo;t it
silly! But my father, who was always my dearest, got
to his grave without that pang; and now in 1890, I (or
what is left of me) go at last to the Navigator Islands.
God go with us! It is but a Pisgah sight when all is
said; I go there only to grow old and die; but when you
come, you will see it is a fair place for the purpose.</p>
